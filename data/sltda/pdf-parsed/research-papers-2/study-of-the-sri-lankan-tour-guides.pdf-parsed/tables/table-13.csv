2.1. Study Framework
The  study  framework  presented  is  aimed  at  enhancing  the  skills  of  TGs  in  Sri  Lanka  by
strengthening  the  tourism  sector  value  chain  (TSVC).  The  process  involves  comprehensive
"data  collection,  analysis,  and  validation  from  various  key  actors  in  the  tourism  industry  to"
"assess current capabilities, forecast future needs, and address skills gaps."
Figure 1:  Study framework
The framework begins with a systematic approach to data collection involving the following
key groups within the tourism sector.
• Tour Guides - TGs
• TOs - Tour operators
• IVs - International Visitors (Tourists)
"•  MSMEs - Micro, small, and medium enterprises"
• Hoteliers
• Industry experts.
The study among TGs aims to assess their current skills and service levels. This foundational
data helps in understanding their strengths and areas requiring improvement. Tour operators
provide  critical  insights  into  the  performance  and  service  quality  of  TGs  from  a  business
"perspective,  highlighting  specific  areas  where  TGs  need  enhancement,  as  well  as the"
"challenges  faced  by  employers  of  TGs.  Further,  tour  operators  are  a  critical  stakeholder"
