Enhancing Skills of Sri Lankan Tour Guides         Study Report
"▪  Neither, accessing nor finding TGs is  very easy for tourists."
"tourists  (22%  and  29%,  respectively)  use  Recommendations  from ▪  The  majority  of"
family/friends and travel agents to find TGs. Another 20 percent of tourists said that they
use online methods. They are mainly younger tourists.
The motivations and challenges faced by the TGs in Sri Lanka:
"▪  Majority of TGs’ motivations to choose tour guiding as their living are independence, pride"
"in  representing  the  country,  interest  to  travel,  and  passion  for  sharing  culture  heritage,"
"followed by many more such as attached respect, desire to meet people and storytelling."
"▪  However, very few started tour-guiding for reasons such as the thrill of being involved in"
"outdoor activities, financial benefits, and career growth-related aspects."
"▪  Nonetheless, it is critical to note how the motives changed when they started tour guiding"
and  to  continue  in  the  job.  The  large  majority’s  motive  to  continue  guiding  is  financial
"benefits, and other motives come next."
"▪  Among many challenges, the most critical is the lack of support and coordination by the"
"authorities, the threat of foreigners coming with their interpreters and leaders, digital trends,"
"seasonal impact due to the freelance nature of the job by many of the TGs, limited facilities,"
"and accommodation when travelling with guests, lack of training, licensing process, and"
hence the identity of the TGs. Licensed TGs mentioned the competition from the unlicensed
TGs as a challenge they are facing.
"▪  Among these challenges, digital nomadism seems to be a larger trend that is common for"
all countries and has the potential to disrupt TGs’ opportunities.
The estimated need for TGs in Sri Lanka & Future trends:
▪  43 percent of tourists interviewed stated that they received TGs’ service this season (Q1
2024)  when  they  travelled  to  Sri  Lanka.  Compared  to  the  TG  service  usage  statistics
"published by SLTDA in 2018 indicate an increase in TG service usage, although a direct"
comparison is not possible between the two studies.
"▪  91 percent of the 43 percent who used the TG service plan to use the TG service next time,"
which indicates that around 40 percent of tourists will use the TG service when visiting
next.
"▪  However, only 64 percent of those who used TG service in the previous visit have used TG"
"service this time, which means repeat usage is only 64 percent."
"▪  The large majority of tourists are first-time visitors to the country, which is 78 percent. And"
45 percent of first-time visitors use the TG service.
"▪  Further, it is important to note that 64 percent of those who have used TG services in Sri"
Lanka have been exposed to TG services in other countries.
