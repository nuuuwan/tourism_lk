Chapter Summary  4 : The Current Estimated Size of TGs & their Characteristics
The research findings on the current population and characteristics of TGs in Sri Lanka reveal a
diverse  and  dynamic  profession.  The  industry  significantly  contributes  to  the  tourism  sector's
"growth  with  nearly  4,887  registered  TGs  and  an  estimated  1,460  unlicensed  guides.  The"
"demographic profile of  TGs is  diverse, spanning different  age groups  and genders. However,"
"there is a significant underrepresentation of female TGs, highlighting the need for initiatives to"
"promote gender diversity within the profession. Further, significantly older TGs would leave the"
profession after their retirement age with the immense competencies they carry. This suggests
proper strategies to be implemented to transfer this knowledge to young TGs by making the older
experienced TG trainers or mentors to young TGs.  The study also highlights the employment
"arrangements of TGs, with a substantial majority working as freelancers. This freelance nature"
provides flexibility  but presents  challenges  such  as income  instability and job  insecurity. The
establishment of income stability and job security is crucial as the majority are breadwinners of
"families, and the livelihood of those families would be largely dependent on the well-being of"
"the TGsâ€™ careers. This becomes more important as most TGs, except National TGs, are relatively"
"average education level  people, limiting other job opportunities in the market  and the lack of"
"transferable  knowledge  developed  within  them,  making  them  primarily  vulnerable  during  the"
off-season.    Addressing  these  challenges  is  crucial  to  ensuring  a  sustainable  and  supportive
"environment  for  TGs.  Additionally,  the  linguistic  skills  of  TGs  are  vital,  with  English  being"
"universally acknowledged as essential, alongside other languages like Russian, German, French,"
and Chinese. These language abilities are critical for effectively catering to a diverse range of
"international tourists, enhancing their experiences in Sri Lanka. Hence, understanding the current"
landscape  and  characteristics  of  TGs  is  fundamental  to  formulating  strategies  that  support
"professional development, job satisfaction, and inclusivity within the tour-guiding profession in"
Sri Lanka. Addressing the challenges identified and capitalizing on the workforce's strengths will
be  instrumental  in  fostering  a  thriving  tourism  sector  that  offers  exceptional  experiences  to
tourists visiting Sri Lanka.
