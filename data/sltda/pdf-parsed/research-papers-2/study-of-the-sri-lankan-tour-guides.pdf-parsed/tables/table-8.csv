"destination  competitiveness. Additionally,  well-trained TGs  can  support  sustainable  tourism",,,
"practices  by  educating  tourists  about  responsible  behaviour,  conservation  efforts,  and  the",,,
"cultural  significance  of  sites,  which  helps  preserve  the  attractions  that  draw  visitors  to  the",,,
country.,,,
The study comprehensively discusses the current/existing pool of TGs in Sri Lanka. This figure,,,
represents  the  total  number  of TGs  who  are  actively  engaged  in  guiding  tourists  across  the,,,
"country. The TG  workforce  comprises  individuals  with  diverse  backgrounds,  qualifications,",,,
and areas of specialization. Some TGs possess extensive knowledge of Sri Lanka's cultural and,,,
"historical heritage, while others are experts in natural and wildlife tours, adventure activities,",,,
or urban excursions. This diversity in expertise allows TGs to cater to a wide range of tourist,,,
"interests and preferences, enhancing the overall visitor experience. As of November 2022, the",,,
"SLTDA  reported  that  4,629  licensed TGs  were  registered  under  their  authority. This  group",,,
"included  1,798  National  Guides,  1,476  Chauffeur  Guides,  1,253 Area  Guides,  and  102  Site",,,
"Guides.  By April  2024,  SLTDA's  records  showed  an  increase  in  registered  TGs  to  4,887,",,,
indicating a growth of 258 guides over approximately 16 months. This reflects a five to six,,,
"percent increase in TGs during this period. The updated distribution includes 1,892 National",,,
"Guides,  1,552  Chauffeur  Guides,  1,339 Area  Guides,  and  104  Site  Guides.  The  study  also",,,
"presented several estimations for the unlicensed TGs as well. However, the TG sector faces a",,,
significant  challenge  in  terms  of  turnover.  Various  factors  contribute  to  TGs  leaving  the,,,
"profession,  including  migration  to  other  countries,  career  changes,  retirement,  and  personal",,,
"reasons. Migration is a notable factor as many skilled TGs seek better opportunities abroad,",,,
"leading to a brain drain within the industry. Career changes are also common, with some TGs",,,
transitioning  to  other  roles  within  the  tourism  sector  or  moving  to  entirely  different  fields.,,,
"Retirement naturally reduces the number of experienced TGs available, and personal reasons",,,
such as health issues or family commitments can also impact the workforce.,,,
Meeting the future demand for TGs requires comprehensive and focused training programs.,,,
There is a need to train approximately 3809 National TGs and 2613 Chauffeur TGs to meet the,,,
future demand. This highlights the importance of focused training programs to equip TGs with,,,
the necessary skills. It discusses the curriculum and training modules necessary to equip TGs,,,
"with the skills required to deliver high-quality services, including language proficiency, cultural",,,
"knowledge, communication techniques, and the use of technology in guiding. Furthermore, the",,,
chapter explores the role of accreditation and certification in maintaining  training standards,,,
and ensuring that TGs possess the competencies needed to meet the expectations of modern,,,
tourists. The findings and recommendations presented in this report hold the potential to serve,,,
as  a  strategic  guide  for  enhancing  the  skills  and  professionalism  of  TGs  in  Sri  Lanka.  By,,,
"fostering  these  improvements,  the  tour  guiding  sector  can  become  more  responsive,  high-",,,
"quality, and instrumental in driving sustainable tourism growth. The report envisions a future",,,
"where  TGs  are  equipped  with  the  knowledge,  skills,  and  recognition  necessary  to  deliver",,,
exceptional  and  memorable,"travel  experiences,  contributing to",the,local  economy  and
upholding the cultural heritage and natural beauty that make Sri Lanka a unique and compelling,,,
destination.,,,
The report identifies several challenges faced by the TG sector in Sri Lanka. One major issue,,,
"is the prevalence of unlicensed guides, which undermines the industry's professionalism and",,,
can  lead  to  inconsistent  service  quality. Addressing  this  requires  stringent  enforcement  of,,,
licensing  regulations  and  public  awareness  campaigns  to  highlight  the  benefits  of  hiring,,,
"licensed guides. Constraints in language proficiency present another challenge, particularly as",,,
