Chapter Summary  5 : Evaluating the Current Importance & Satisfaction Levels of TGs
The  literature  has  proven  the  significance  of  the  TG  profession  for  the  tourism  industry
"worldwide,  especially  for  countries  whose  primary  source  of  national  income  is  tourism."
"Similarly, TGs are critical resources for the sustainability and growth of the tourism industry in"
Sri Lanka. The study data and insight proved it unambiguously. This positive sentiment on TGs
"can be found among all the key stakeholders, including tour operators, hoteliers, and MSMEs."
"Even  when  trying  to  understand  the  importance  of  TGs  for  the  businesses  of  tour  operators,"
"hoteliers, and MSMEs, there was a surprising finding among MSMEs, which shows that MSMEs"
are  not  very  happy  with  the  TG  service.  This  was  mainly  driven  by  the  negative  experience
MSMEs had dealing with TG and seeing how they miscommunicated the prices of the goods to
"their clients. Further, complex negotiation for commissions by the TGs from MSMEs has shown"
"the need for fair-trade understanding among the TGs. Nevertheless, it is essential to note that the"
"most critical stakeholder group for TG service, tourists, have demonstrated higher satisfaction"
"with the TG service in Sri Lanka. Moreover, most tourists seem overwhelmed by their decision"
"to tour Sri Lanka. Therefore, most of the tourists recommend TG services in Sri Lanka. Tourists'"
only concern about TGs is the lack of transparent platforms and sources to find dependable TGs
"in  Sri  Lanka.  Therefore,  relevant  authorities  should  be  concerned  with  developing  a  central"
database  of  TGs  to  maintain  the  profiles  of  TGs  in  the  country  and  market  them  in  suitable
touchpoints worldwide.
