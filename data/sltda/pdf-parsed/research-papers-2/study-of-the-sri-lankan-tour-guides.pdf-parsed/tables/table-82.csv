Enhancing Skills of Sri Lankan Tour Guides,,Study Report
"In the same way, licensed TGs face challenges from unlicensed TGs. Therefore, licensed TG",,
"expects the attention of authority to control the situation. “The presence of unlicensed guides,",,
"who may offer lower prices or operate outside regulatory frameworks, threatens licensed TGs'",,
livelihoods and professional standards”.,,
"Moreover, the lack  of  coordination  extends",to  missed,training  opportunities.  Continuous
professional development is essential for TGs to stay competitive and knowledgeable about new,,
"trends and best practices in the tourism industry. Unfortunately, many guides report that they are",,
"not  informed  about  available  training  programs  or  workshops,  which  limits  their  ability  to",,
enhance their skills and service offerings. This deficiency affects their professional growth and,,
impacts  the  quality  of  services  provided  to  tourists.  Access  to  necessary  resources  is  another,,
"significant challenge. TGs often require various tools and materials, such as maps, brochures,",,
"and access to historical archives, to enrich their tours. However, the support from authorities in",,
providing  these  resources  is  frequently  inadequate.  TGs  struggle  to  deliver  informative  and,,
"engaging  experiences  without the necessary materials,  which can diminish tourist satisfaction",,
and repeat business.,,
Effective coordination and communication from relevant authorities are essential for ensuring,,
"that TGs are well-informed about events, tourism policies, and other critical information that can",,
"enhance their service delivery. For instance, awareness of local festivals, public transportation",,
"changes,  or  new  attractions  can  enable  TGs  to  plan  better  and  provide  more  comprehensive",,
"services. When such information is not readily available or communicated late, it hampers the",,
TGs’ ability to adapt and offer an optimal experience.,,
"A  guide  highlighted  a  missed  important  event:  “There  has  been  an  ""Angampora''  [A  Sri",,
Lankan traditional martial art] event on the western side of Ruwanweli Seya [A pagoda]. It,,
has been well organized but went unnoticed due to lack of coordination and communication,,
"by  the  authorities.  There  are  many  programs  we  could  benefit  from,  but  we  rarely  get",,
"information  about  them.  We  need  more  proactive  communication  from  the  authorities.""-",,
Chauffeur TGs.,,
The consequences of these challenges are far-reaching. TGs may struggle with job performance,,
"without proper support and communication, decreasing service quality and tourist satisfaction.",,
This affects their livelihoods and has broader implications for the tourism industry’s reputation,,
and sustainability.,,
