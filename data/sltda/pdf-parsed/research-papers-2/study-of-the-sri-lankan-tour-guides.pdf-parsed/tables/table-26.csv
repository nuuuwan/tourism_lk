2.2.4. Challenges and Study Boundaries
1.  Difficulty  in  contacting  Tour  Operators  and  TGs  for  the  research  due  to  the  peak
season
"TGs  and  tour  operators  were  heavily  occupied  with  their  duties,  guiding  and  attending  to"
"tourists  during  the  data  collection  period,  which  left  them  with  limited  time  for  additional"
"activities. As a result, contacting them for research purposes became feasible only after the"
"peak season. However, all planned discussions with TGs were conducted as scheduled. Some"
discussions were shifted to online sessions held during the night hours to accommodate their
daytime unavailability.
