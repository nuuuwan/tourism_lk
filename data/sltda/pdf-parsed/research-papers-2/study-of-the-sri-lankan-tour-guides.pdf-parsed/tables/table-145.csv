Enhancing Skills of Sri Lankan Tour Guides         Study Report
III. Develop TGs with Multipurpose skills - Training TGs with versatile skills to transfer
"knowledge to adjacent areas such as coaching, teaching their specialized areas, content"
creation etc. Developing multipurpose skills of TGs will reduce the vulnerability during
"off-season as they will be able involve in other viable jobs. However, further research"
is needed to identify the multipurpose skills that can be trained to TGs and curricular
for such programs.
IV. Enhance the reachability/accessibility of TGs by tourists - There should be an online
platform that is updated with profiles and track records of TGs that tourists can easily
access so that they can easily find and choose their TGs. Especially in a market with
"many freelance, informal TGs, this online platform will ensure opportunities for good"
quality TGs.
V. Provide necessary  control for tourist bringing their interpreters â€“ One of the major
challenge for NTGs and CTGs is the  trend of tourists bringing their interpreters when
"traveling to Sri Lanka replacing the role of the NTGs or the CTGs.  Further, Russian"
and Chinese visitors living in Sri Lanka have started providing services for tourists who
are coming from  their  countries.   This  needs  regulatory  control  and  attention  to
safeguard the business opportunities of NTGs and CTGs.
"However,  the  main  reason  claimed  by  the  tourists  for  them  to  come  with  their"
"interpreters is the lack of language  proficiency of TGs in Sri Lanka. Therefore, only"
regulatory controls will not bring sustainable solutions if not steps are  taken to
have  TGs  with  foreign  language  fluency.  It  was  also  identified  that  language  like
"Chinese and Russian would take  considerably longer time to teach.  Therefore,"
certain short terms steps like hiring University students passed out with  language
qualification as translators of TGs or hiring them as TGs would be important.
