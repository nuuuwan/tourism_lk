Enhancing Skills of Sri Lankan Tour Guides,Study Report
Another  point  for  identity  branding  is  in  the  way  the  identity  of  the  TG  is  presented.  Tour,
companies and operators will promote their services and that of the TGs. They might even have,
"dedicated websites for this. However, having a cohesive brand identity that is easily recognizable",
even on a  website is  essential  in  the modern day as many tourists are self-sufficient  and will,
investigate their trip details. It is not enough to merely have the names and pictures of the TGs,
"available (Sri Lanka Travel, n.d.-b); the website also needs to appeal to visitors. They need to",
have a sense of connection with the concept of TGs so that they can obtain the services of one,
"with  assurance.  As  per  Nguyen  (2015),  “Organizations  should  attempt  to  go  beyond  simply",
satisfying customers and build customer loyalty.” By building an identifiable brand around the,
"TG profession, there is a focal point to which customer loyalty can be tied.",
There is  a lot of  emphasis  on licenses  and the recognition  of licensed and unlicensed guides.,
Recognition and respect for licensed TGs are crucial for maintaining professional standards in,
the tourism industry. Licensed guides undergo rigorous training and certification processes to,
"ensure  they  can  provide  knowledgeable  and  high-quality  services.  However,  the  presence  of",
unlicensed  guides  and  a  lack  of  public  awareness  about  the  importance  of  licensing  can,
undermine  their  efforts.  Enhancing  the  recognition  and  visibility  of  licensed  guides  through,
public awareness campaigns and stricter enforcement of licensing regulations can help elevate,
"the profession's status and ensure that tourists receive the best possible guidance. Nonetheless, a",
fundamental argument exists about the license's purpose if even the Tourist Police cannot refer,
to it in an emergency.,
"“While there are licensing requirements for TGs, the tourist police do not possess adequate powers",
to check the TG licenses. What is the purpose of having the license?” - Private Sector Experts,
"Tour Operators are a key stakeholder group in the employment of TGs in the country. Therefore,",
"their perspective on TGs is critical in their career progression. However, the study revealed that",
tour operators have mixed feelings about licensed TGs. Some believe that licensed TGs are the,
"most vital segment, whereas others do not trust or value licensed TGs at all. There is another",
segment of tour operators who have indifferent views on licensed and unlicensed TGs.,
