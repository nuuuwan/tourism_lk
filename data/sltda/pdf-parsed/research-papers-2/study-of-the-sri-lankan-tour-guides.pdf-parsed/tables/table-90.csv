Enhancing Skills of Sri Lankan Tour Guides   Study Report
New Zealand
New Zealand's approach to TG licensing differs from many countries
"as it does not have a mandatory national licensing requirement. Instead,"
"regulations are determined by specific locations, particularly those of"
"cultural  or  environmental  importance.  For  instance,  guiding  within"
"national  parks like  Tongariro  often requires  permits,  and tours involving  MƒÅori  culture"
"necessitate recognition from local iwi (People) to ensure cultural sensitivity. Additionally, while"
"not  obligatory,  obtaining  a  Qualmark (the tourism industry's  official  quality  assurance"
organization in New Zealand)  endorsement can enhance a guide's credibility and professionalism
"by  meeting  high  standards  in  knowledge,  safety,  and  customer  service.  Thus,  New  Zealand's"
system  emphasizes local regulations  and  voluntary  endorsements to  ensure  quality  and
professionalism in tour guiding.
