Attitudes Towards Licensing
"Nearly half of the TGs surveyed believe it is worth taking a license and starting the job, whereas"
the other half think it is better to start tour guiding and see whether that fits to continue and then
"pursue the license-taking process.  As per the TGsâ€™ experience, obtaining the license to work as"
"a TG earlier was not a necessity. Therefore, some TGs still believe that first practicing and then"
"getting a license if needed is recommended. While the trend is similar among all types of TGs,"
"the majority, like 52 percent of Unlicensed TGs, think that a license is not a mandate to start tour"
guiding (refer to Figure 30).
