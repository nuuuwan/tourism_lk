Estimate of Tourist Numbers Using TG Service During 2023 & till April 2024 â€“ Bottom-
Up Approach
What is the Bottom-Up Approach? Estimate the number of tourists who use TG from the number
of active TGs servicing in Sri Lanka and apply the average number of tourists they service at a
"time and the number of trips they do in a typical year. In this case, as the study was conducted"
"in April 2024, 16 months, including 12 months in 2023 and four months in 2024, were counted"
for estimates and then converted to 12-month usage.
The data gathered from this study was used to estimate the types of tourists handled by every
"kind of TGs, the number of tourists they hold at a time, and how many such trips in a year, as"
presented in Error! Reference source not found..
"Further, the assumption made here is that most tourists make their first contact with the NTGs/"
"CTGs/ ULTGs who work under tour operators, and when it comes to the Areas and Sites, the"
"same tourists are served by the Area and Site Guides. Therefore, to eliminate double counting,"
Area and Site guides are not considered for this calculation.
The estimates captured from both approaches (top-bottom & bottom-up) are expected to validate
each other.
