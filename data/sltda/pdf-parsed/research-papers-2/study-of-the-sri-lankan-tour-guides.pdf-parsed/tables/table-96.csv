Does  the  Implementation  of  Tourism  Licensing  Mechanisms  Directly  Affect  the,,,
Economic Contribution of Tourism to a Country's GDP?,,,
Tourism licensing mechanisms are designed to standardize the quality and professionalism of,,,
"tourism services,  ensuring that TGs and operators meet certain standards. This regulation  can",,,
"lead to an enhanced visitor experience, potentially increasing tourist satisfaction, repeat visits,",,,
"and positive reviews. In countries with stringent licensing requirements, such as Italy and Greece,",,,
there is a notable contribution of tourism to GDP (5.7% and 6.0% respectively). These countries,,,
benefit from a regulated tourism industry that maintains high standards and attracts international,,,
tourists.,,,
"Conversely, in countries without a national licensing mechanism, the impact on GDP varies. For",,,
"example,  Australia  and  Canada,  which  lack  a  national  licensing  system,  have  lower  tourism",,,
"contributions to GDP (1.97% and 1.0% respectively). However, the absence of a national system",,,
"does not necessarily preclude a significant tourism sector, as seen in Germany and the United",,,
"States, where local or regional regulations can still maintain high standards.",,,
The implementation of tourism licensing mechanisms does have a positive effect on a country's,,,
economy by potentially increasing the tourism sector's contribution to GDP. Countries with well-,,,
"regulated tourism industries tend to see higher economic benefits from tourism. Therefore, while",,,
"not  the  sole  factor,  robust  tourism  licensing  mechanisms  play  a  crucial  role  in  enhancing  the",,,
economic impact of tourism (refer to Table 10 in the annexure).,,,
Lack of CPD,,,
Continuous improvements in the TG profession are vital to sustaining the demand and staying,,,
up to date with the new trends in the market. This is also identified as the best mechanism to be,,,
integrated  with the license,renewal  and  career  enhancement  processes.  Considering,,the
significance  of the industry  and the  TG,to,the,"industry,  having  Continuous  professional"
"development, CPD is a critical step that should be taken by the higher authority of the industry.",,,
"This would solve many of the challenges faced by TG, such as issues faced at the license renewal,",,,
"recognition  of  the  profession,  career  progression  and  performance,  and  ability  to  manage  the",,,
"threat from foreign TGs, and reduce the vulnerability of the TG profession.",,,
