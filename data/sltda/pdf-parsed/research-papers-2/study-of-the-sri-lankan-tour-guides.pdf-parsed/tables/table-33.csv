"SLTDA's updated records indicate a significant increase in registered TGs, with the total now"
"standing at  4,887. This increase of 258 guides over approximately 16 months reflects  growth"
across all guide categories. This indicates a five to six percentage increase in TGs registered at

expansion of the tourism sector in Sri Lanka. It highlights a robust increase in both workforce
capacity and the country's appeal as a tourist destination. The following Figure (refer to Figure 5)
