L,"ack of Support, Communication, and Coordination from the Relevant Authority",,,,,,,,
"The TGs often navigate a complex and dynamic industry, yet  they face significant challenges",,,,,,,,,
"due to  the need for more structured support, coordination, and effective  communication from",,,,,,,,,
relevant authorities. This absence of support can lead to numerous operational difficulties that,,,,,,,,,
hinder their ability to deliver high-quality services to tourists. One of the primary issues is the,,,,,,,,,
lack of timely updates on new regulations and policies. TGs must be informed about changes in,,,,,,,,,
tourism,"laws,  safety  protocols,  and  entry",,,requirements,,to  provide  accurate  and  current,,,
"information  to  their  clients.  However,  communication  from  authorities  is  often  sporadic  and",,,,,,,,,
"inefficient,",leaving  TGs,in,the  dark,about,critical  updates.  This,gap,can,result,in
"misunderstandings, compliance issues, and a decline in the overall tourist experience.",,,,,,,,,
T,he impact of these challenges is reflected in the voices of TGs gathered at the interviews. Many,,,,,,,,
express  frustrations  over  the  lack  of  support  and  feeling  neglected  by  authorities.  One  TG,,,,,,,,,
"mentioned, ""We often learn about new regulations through our clients rather than through",,,,,,,,,
"official channels. It makes us look unprofessional.""",,,,,,,,,
"Further, as discussed above, value chain actors in the industry believe that authorities should take",,,,,,,,,
some  action  regarding  the  invasion  of  foreign  interpreters  into  the  country.  “Russian  and,,,,,,,,,
"Chinese  bring  their  country's  TGs,  known  as  ""Tour  Leaders.”  In  Sri  Lanka,  many  in  the",,,,,,,,,
"industry refer to these guides as ""Interpreters."" Often, these tourists travel with their leaders",,,,,,,,,
and may not hire a local guide due to language barriers. There is no control for these things,,,,,,,,,
imposed by the authority.”,,,,,,,,,
