a)  Licensing and License Renewal Process:,
I.,"Streamline License Process - Establish a clear, streamlined process for licensing TGs."
,After candidates have completed  their  pre-requisite  trainings  from  SLITHM  and
,"other recognized  associations,  SLTDA  should  consider  conducting  an  entrance"
,exam/test/interview  before issuing  a license  specially  for the  National  TGs  and
,Chauffeur TGs.
II.,License  unlicensed  TGs  –  Propose to implement  a  mechanism to licensing the
,unlicensed TGs. This mechanism should prioritize licensing the unlicensed guides who
,"are having high level of language skills, commitment, and passionate of their job. The"
,"test of their past track records, reviews, and soft skills is vital. The study showed that"
,"there  are  unlicensed  TGs  working  under  tour  operators.  Therefore,  collaborate  with"
,small scale tour operators in licensing of unlicensed would be a relevant approach.
III.,License  Compensated  volunteers  –  The  study  revealed  that  there  are  volunteers
,(including  graduates)  working  as  TGs for  a small  compensation  paid  by the
,government.  It  is  important  to  identify  such  cohorts  in  the  country  and  evaluate  the
,skills and create a path for them to work as professional licensed TGs.
IV.,Assess  fragmentation  of  Areas  and  Site  Guides  –  Site  guides  and  Area  guides  are
,scattered across the country and experts believe that there should be a higher number
,"of such guides in the country who are not registered. Therefore, an initiative should be"
,taken to build a database of TGs to register all who work as TGs in different sites and
,areas.
