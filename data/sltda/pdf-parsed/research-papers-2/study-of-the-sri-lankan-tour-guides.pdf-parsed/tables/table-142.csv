CHAPTER 07: FUTURE RESEARCH
1.  Research is needed to identify transferable skill sets that TGs can learn and develop
"to  stay  occupied  during  the  off-season.  Ideally,  these  skills  should  be  aligned  with"
"tourism and tour guiding, but the primary goal is to provide TGs with opportunities to"
earn income during periods of low demand.
2.  Digital nomadism was identified as a trend that is already significant globally and has
impacted TGs’ profession. A deeper analysis should be carried out to find other case
studies that demonstrate how TGs remain resilient to the impacts of digital nomadism.
"3.  Tourists  (Chinese  and  Russian)  come  with  their  interpreters,  or  Chinese  and"
Russians living in Sri Lanka play the role of guides when their nationalities come as
"tourists to Sri Lanka without using licensed TGs’ service, which is identified as a threat"
to the TGs in Sri Lanka. Future research is important to understand the severity of this
trend's impact on the Sri Lankan TGs’ profession and career and to identify possible
private sector and public sector interventions to manage the situation.
4.  Future  research  should  aim  to  identify  specialized  areas  where  TGs  can  develop
"advanced  skills  to  enhance  their  job  performance.  Based  on  these  findings,  training"
programs can be designed to support the identified specialization topics.
