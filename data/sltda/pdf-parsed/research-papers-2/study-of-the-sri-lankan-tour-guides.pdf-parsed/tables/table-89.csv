reconsideration of providing special facilities for digital nomads and further investigation into,
positioning TGs within these evolving trends.,
Identity for Tour Guides and Recognition for the Licensed Tour Guides,
"After COVID-19, the requirements of travellers changed. Preferences and needs changed to adapt",
"to a world post-pandemic, a world that had become more technologically abled. More services",
"and products are online, and the advent of AI in all areas of life means that travellers have access",
"to more information and services than ever before. Travellers are seeking authentic experiences,",
and community-based. are the unofficial ambassadors of a country”. The image a TG presents,
to tourists is the image that will be remembered at the end of their holiday. One way to leverage,
"this is always to have the brand identity of the profession visible, like a badge or a uniform, but",
going beyond that to provide an identity that will become synonymous with Sri Lankan TGs.,
According  to  Liu  et  al  (2021)  a  strong  brand  can  boost  the  purchase  intentions  of  tourists.,
"Therefore, the status of the TG must be promoted as a desirable commodity of the overall tourism",
"product, both to potential tourists and within the local tourism community.",
"No such brand identity is currently available for TGs in Sri Lanka. Therefore, TGs are largely",
unseen  in  the  tourism  value  chain.  Their  overall  value  is  mostly  unremarked  upon  and  goes,
"unnoticed, although they are a focal point of interaction between tourists and other value chain",
"actors, including local communities. Identity branding, however, is not solely dependent upon",
"uniform or dress code. For instance, in Sri Lanka, licensed TGs are provided with documentation",
"providing their status. This is an elementary form of identity branding, but it needs to provide a",
tangible brand to which visitors can relate. It would be hard to filter the best and worst TGs in,
Sri Lanka right now due to the lack of a proper system. TG license is the only formal identity,
given to TGs in Sri Lanka. Does licensing alone elevate the identity of TGs?. Examples of good,
"identity branding can be found in different parts of the world, one of the most prominent being",
that of the Blue Badge tourist guide in the United Kingdom. The ‘Blue Badge’ has become a,
sought-after symbol for those in the tour guiding profession in the United Kingdom.,
