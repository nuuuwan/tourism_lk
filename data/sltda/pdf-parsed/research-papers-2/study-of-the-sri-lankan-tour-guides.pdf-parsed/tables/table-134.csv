"assume that minimum TG service usage could be dropped to 27 percent in the next season,"
"▪  Therefore, for planning purposes, a maximum of 40 percent- minimum of 27 percent TG"
service usage could be expected in the coming season.
▪  Taking this minimum and maximum TG service usage estimation into consideration and
"considering the 4 million tourist target the ministry is aiming to achieve in 2030, it was"

9336.
It was found that there is approximately 25 percent of National and Chauffeur TGs turnover ▪
"could be expected due to migration and other reasons, and hence, we would have 2914 in"
"the pool, and a maximum of 9336 should be trained to meet the future demand."
"▪  Nonetheless, the estimated number of unlicensed TGs is 1066; after absorbing that, only"
"8270 of the max pool of National and Chauffeur guides should be trained new. NTG, and"
"CTG size would be after turnover 1848, then new recruitment of NTG & CTG need is 6422."
"▪  Of course, these estimates are subject to any change in the number of tourists visiting the"
"country and the impact of other factors, such as digitalization."
