"Among the tourists who have used TG services in Sri Lanka, 64 percent have used TG services",
"in other countries. That means out of 43 percent who used TG service in Sri Lanka, 64 percent",
have used TG service in other countries and are considered the most loyal or frequent TG service,
users when traveling. That means 27 percent (64% of 43%) could be the lowest TG user share,
"we expect,  assuming  that  this segment of 27 percent  of tourists most likely  would need TG",
when traveling.,
"However, to calculate the required quantity of TGs for future demand, as discussed above 40",
"percent TG user share will be taken as the maximum TG service usage, although the lowest",
possible that it can go down to 27 percent.,
Estimate of TG Turnover in the Future.,
This study learned that a smaller segment of TGs does not plan to continue in the TG job due,
to  migration  and  other  plans.  Around  88  percent  of  TGs  mentioned  that  they  will  continue,
working as TGs in the country; only 12 percent have shaky thoughts on that. The pattern of,
"future turnover is common across all types of TGs, as displayed in the charts below (refer to",
