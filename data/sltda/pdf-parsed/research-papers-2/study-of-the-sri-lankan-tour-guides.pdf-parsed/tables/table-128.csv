Enhancing Skills of Sri Lankan Tour Guides,Study Report
Cultural Relativism,
As discussed above cultural sensitivity in TGs’' work is highlighted as a key requirement as per,
"the guidelines of WFTGA. However, the Sri Lankan TG Curriculum lacks a thorough focus on",
cultural sensitivity. This incident underscores the critical need for comprehensive training for,
"TGs, emphasizing respect for tourists' religious beliefs and privacy. Integrating concepts like",
cultural relativism into training programs is essential to prevent ethnocentrism.,
Cultural sensitivity is highly valued by tourists and vital for a positive experience. The following,
quotation will explain the incident faced by a “UK Couple” and demonstrate the urgency of,
cultural relativism as a skill for TGs.,
"“There were several experiences, which were very disappointing with a TG. One that stands",
out was when we visited the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy. The TG insisted that we participate,
"in  a  worship  ceremony,  even  though  we  told  him  we  don't  follow  any  specific  religion.  We",
"respect all religions, but we don't engage in rituals. Despite our objections, he kept pushing us",
"to do things we weren't comfortable with. And then, after we politely declined to participate, he",
"got quite upset. He even complained to the hotel, saying we disrespected the local culture. It",
was just too much.”- UK Couple describing an incident that happened during their tour.,
