"It is unarguable that the ability of TGs in Sri Lanka to speak English, Russian, German, French,",,
and Mandarin are critical to ensure an enjoyable and memorable visit for most tourists. Based,,
"on the most recent statistics published by SLTDA as presented below, it is clear that Indians",,
"and Chinese are the most extensively attracted tourists to Sri Lanka. Russian, British, German,",,
"and French are more attracted to Sri Lanka than to other Asian countries.  Therefore, it is clear",,
that the demand for TGs can be increased by preparing them to speak these languages.,,
,Figure 70: Language skills prioritization based on the type of tourists for Sri Lanka,
"As discussed above, one of the important factors observed is that fewer TGs can speak other",,
foreign languages except English. The following figure demonstrate this fact. It was noted that,,
"Ninety-nine percent of TGs stated that they are fluent in English. However, not even 30 percent",,
"of TGs can speak other important foreign languages like German, French, Mandarin, Hundi, etc.",,
"Therefore, taking steps to fill these language proficiency gaps among the TGs is paramount.",,
