Enhancing Skills of Sri Lankan Tour Guides         Study Report
"• The majority of National TGs handle groups, which is prominent compared with others."
Unlicensed guides seem to guide more Solo and family/couples.
"• The most salient and hardest destination for the TGs to handle is India, as per the majority."
"TGs mostly handle German, British, French, Australian, and Russian clients."
• An average of 7-8 nationalities have been handled by an average TG.
"• Accordingly,  TGs  believe  that  successful  TGs  should  have  fluency  in  English,  with"
"Russian, German, French, and Chinese, to service most tourists coming to the country."
"• It is notable to see, many have fluency in English, but very few, around 30 percent, can"
"speak German. TGs who can speak the other needed languages such as Chinese, Japanese"
are very few in the country.
"• It is pleasing to see a few multilingual TGs, especially the licensed TGs, in the country."
"• However, fluency in a language other than English seems to be a critical issue faced by the"
TGs in the country.
"• Nonetheless, an average 2-language capability is shown by a TG, with less fluency in a"
"second language other than English. However, the observation of other value chain actors"
in the English fluency of some TGs seems concerning.
