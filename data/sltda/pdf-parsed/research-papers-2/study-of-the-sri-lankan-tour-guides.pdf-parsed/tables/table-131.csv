Current estimated size of TGs pool in Sri Lanka:,
•,"As recorded by SLTDA, there are 4887 licensed TGs by March 2024, which indicates a 5-"
,6 percent growth since November 2022.
•,"This licensed TG pool comprised 1,892 National TGs, 1,552 Chauffeur TGs, 104 Site TGs,"
,"and 1,339 Area TGs."
•,"According to the survey findings, including unlicensed TGs, there is 32 percent of National"
,"TGs, 25 percent of Chauffeur TGs, 4 percent of Site TGs, 16 percent of Area TGs, and 23"
,percent of unlicensed TGs in the country.
•,"Applying  this  incident  rate,  it  was  estimated  that  there  are  6347  TGs,  including  both"
,licensed and unlicensed.
•,"However, the unlicensed TG space is fragmented, and hence, it is fair to assume that this"
,"estimate would not cover all other informal TGs, such as Tuk-Tuk drivers, city boys, surf"
,"boys, etc."
