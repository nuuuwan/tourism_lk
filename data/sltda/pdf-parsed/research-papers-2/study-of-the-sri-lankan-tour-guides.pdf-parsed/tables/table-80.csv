"Seasonal variation in tourism significantly affects the job stability of TGs. During peak seasons,",
"the demand for TGs is high, providing ample employment opportunities. However, in off-peak",
"seasons, the demand drops, leading to reduced work and income insecurity. This cyclical nature",
of tourism can make it challenging for TGs to sustain a stable livelihood throughout the year.,
"Therefore, sometimes, TGs use peak season to optimize their income to compensate for the off-",
season’s survival. This could be one of the reasons for their desperate approach to earning money,
through commissions.,
H,"owever, from the TGs perspective, some interventions are required to facilitate TGs during the"
"off-season. Some TGs suggest increasing the fee during peak season, and some suggest arranging",
"concessions during the off-season. However, TGs servicing Chinese tourists seem to enjoy the",
"income stream throughout the year, as some tour operators claim. Similarly, developing strategies",
"to attract other tourists during off-peak periods is crucial. Further, diversifying TGs’ skill sets to",
engage in other tourism-related activities during off season can help mitigate this vulnerability.,
The quotations from qualitative discussions below provided evidence to show the TGs’ concern,
about off-season struggle.,
