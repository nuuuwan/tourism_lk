2.2. Research Methodology
Figure 2: Research approach
The  research  methodology  for
this  study  employs  a  mixed-
"method  approach, integrating"
both qualitative and
quantitative research. This
approach  is  underpinned  by  a
comprehensive literature
review  conducted  before  data
collection. The study includes a
variety of qualitative and
"quantitative  samples,  ensuring"
that all significant stakeholders
(as outlined in the above study
framework)  are  appropriately
engaged. This engagement allows for the collection of crucial insights necessary to address the
research objectives and answer research questions.
"The inception phase of this research involved an extensive desk review (Step 1), which laid"
the  groundwork  by  absorbing  relevant  knowledge  from  existing literature.  This  review
"informed the subsequent stages of the research design, ensuring a robust foundation for data"
"collection and analysis.  In Step 2,  qualitative research methods are employed to  gather in-"
"depth insights from key stakeholders. This involves unstructured interviews, focus groups, and"
field observations that facilitate a deeper understanding of TGsâ€™ skills and service levels and
the  expectations  and  experiences  of  various  actors  in  the  tourism  sector.  Step  3  involves
"quantitative research methods, which include surveys and statistical analyses to quantify the"
"data collected. This phase aims to provide measurable evidence of the current skills, service"
"levels, and future demand for TGs. The qualitative insights complement the quantitative data,"
offering a comprehensive view of the current state and future needs of TGs in Sri Lanka. By
"combining these research methods, the study ensures a holistic approach to data collection,"
enabling a thorough assessment of the skills gaps and service requirements. The mixed-method
approach  enhances  the  reliability  of  the  findings  and  ensures  that  the  perspectives  of  all
relevant stakeholders are captured and considered in the final analysis.
