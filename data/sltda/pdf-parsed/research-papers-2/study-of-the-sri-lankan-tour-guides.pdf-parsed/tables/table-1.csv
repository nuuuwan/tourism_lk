"MESSAGE FROM CHAIRMAN, SLTDA"
Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority is pleased to present this insightful report on the
"research conducted on tour guides in Sri Lanka. This vital research, made possible through the"
"financial assistance provided by S4IG, represents a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts"
to enhance the quality and effectiveness of tour guiding services in our country.
"Tour guides are the lifeblood of our tourism industry, serving as the first point of contact for"
many visitors and playing a crucial role in shaping their experiences. This research provides a
"thorough  analysis  of  the  current  state  of  tour  guiding  in  Sri  Lanka,  highlighting  both  the"
strengths and areas where improvements are needed.
The findings and recommendations outlined will be instrumental in guiding our future policies
and training programs.  Our goal  is  to  ensure that  our tour guides not  only  meet  but  exceed
"international  standards  of  excellence,  thereby  enhancing  the  overall  tourist  experience  and"
promoting Sri Lanka as a premier destination.
I extend my deepest gratitude to the Australian Government funded S4IG program for their
unwavering  support  and  dedication  to  this  important  project.  I  also  wish  to  thank  Survey
Research  Lanka  (Pvt)  Ltd  for  successfully  conducting  the  survey  and  providing  valuable
"insights. Together, we can continue to elevate the standards of our tourism sector and provide"
unforgettable experiences to all who visit our beautiful island.
