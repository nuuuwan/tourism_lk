Stakeholders Perception about the Importance of Tour Guides,,
"As earlier mentioned, TGs are considered “Unofficial Ambassadors” of the country, and those",,
"words emphasize their significance and utmost importance to the tourism industry. Nevertheless,",,
a  comprehensive  concentration  on,the  perception  of  other  stakeholders  regarding  TGs,is
important because the tourism sector is a value chain that consists of all the stakeholders; they,,
"depend on each other. Hence, this chapter will provide a deep exploration of other stakeholders'",,
perceptions of the importance of TGs. Different scholars have defined and identified the value,,
of  TGs  and tour-guiding  services,"in  different  ways.  However,  everyone  emphasises",the
importance of the TG service to establish and sustain the image and reputation of the destination,,
and hence how abreast the TG skills should be to meet the evolving needs of the tourist.,,
,"“Travel is more accessible and affordable than ever, and the role of the TG is becoming",
,"more structured and diverse. With the advent of modern technology and the internet, the",
,role of the TG has been evolving even faster. Tourists are now better informed about the,
,"places they visit, and TGs must also keep up with these trends to provide high-calibre,",
"online TG service” (Aboelmagd, 2023; Rabotic, 2009).",,
,“The value in tour guiding comes from the enjoyment afforded to the tourist. The tourists’,
,frame  of  context  of  a  destination  is  wholly  dependent  upon  the  interpretation  of  the,
,"destination. It is built on the stories and the information, the anecdotes, and the inside",
"local information not available elsewhere” (Haugen, 2022).",,
,"“A  trained  TG  can  provide  all  of  these  factors  and  more.  If  done  with  knowledge,",
,"dedication, and care, it can give a point of value to tourists and positively impact their",
,experience  at  a  destination.  TGs  can  improve  the  image  and  reputation  of  tourist,
"destinations by providing a quality service” (Nejmeddin, 2019).",,
"Answering the question, ‘To what extent do you think TGs are important to your business and",,
"industry?’ tour operators, hoteliers, and MSMEs have shared their perspectives (refer to Figure",,
"33, Figure 34, Figure 35). Interestingly, the interviewed tour operators (The closest stakeholders to",,
TGs  from  an  employment  point  of  view)  stated  that  TGs  are  100  percent  important  to  their,,
"business and also very important to the industry (94%). However, the numbers change when it",,
"comes to the hoteliers and MSMEs. From hoteliers’ point of view, 58 percent mentioned that",,
"TGs are extremely important to their business, and 42 percent of MSMEs mentioned that TGs",,
"are  important  to  their  business.  On  the  other  hand,  they  mentioned  TGs  are  important  to  the",,
industry from a larger number rather than the importance to their business.,,
