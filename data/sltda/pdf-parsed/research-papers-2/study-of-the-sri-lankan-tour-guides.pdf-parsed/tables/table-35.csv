"However,  many  of  the  value  chain  actors  who  were  subjected  to  the  study,  such  as  industry",,,
"experts, tour operators, and even TGs, believe that many other segments of people act as TGs",,,
"and provide TG service to tourists. Therefore, the TG population includes many informal guides,",,,
"which makes the TG profession fragmented. For instance, there are Three-wheeler drivers who",,,
"act  as  TGs,  which  are  commonly  found  in  the  country's  popular  tourist  areas.  Some  of  these",,,
"informal guides are named after Surf Boy, City Boy, etc. The below-presented quotation from",,,
MSMEs and National TGs provides some evidence to it.,,,
"“Some guides who bring tourists, for example, three-wheel drivers, don't have much knowledge. They",,,
"cannot properly speak in English. They say, 'come & go' and ‘yes & no’.  I doubt whether the tourists",,,
get any experience of Sri Lanka”- MSMEs,,,
“These days most of the school leavers get a three-wheeler and just join the industry thinking that they,,,
can do tourism”- National TG,,,
