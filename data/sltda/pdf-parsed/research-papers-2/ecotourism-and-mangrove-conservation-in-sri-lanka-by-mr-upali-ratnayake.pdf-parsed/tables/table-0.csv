Abstract
"Conservation  of  mangroves is  a  primary  responsibility  of  mankind  as  a  contribution to  society, the"
"environment and related ecosystems. In this regard Sri Lanka has taken many initiatives,a leading example"
"being the restoration of 2004 Tsunami-hit mangroves in lagoons in the east, west and south of the island."
"The involvement  of  communities,  experts  and  nongovernmental  organisations in this  endeavour  was"
"commendable.  However,  the  lack  of  continuous  economic  benefits  to  the  neighbouring  communities,  has"
challenged the long-term  sustainability  of  mangrove rehabilitation  efforts in  many  areas.  External
"intervention  and  resources,  over  a  considerable  period,  seems  essential  to  conserve  and  restore  the"
"original flora. Considering current trends, introduction of tourism with visitor facilities for research, study and"
ecotourism  activities  will  be  an  opportunity  to  generate  additional  or  alternative  income  for  mangrove
stakeholders.  When  mangroves  are  used  as  a  resource  base  to  generate  substantial  economic  benefits
"from activities such as operating eco-lodges, mangrove tours and other mangrove ecotourism activities, the"
stakeholders will be motivated to protect their resource base while using it sustainably.
"In the study area in Kalpitiya, tourism was the primary source of income for 51.8% of the community and a"
secondary  source  of income for  28.5%; the tourist  activities  were  mostly  associated  with  mangrove
environments. The  study  also revealed  that  mangrove areas generate many  non-economic  benefits  such
"as providing  an  environment  and nesting  sites for  birds, enabling  the existence and continuity  of  wetland"
"ecosystems, and protection of rare, site-specific faunal species. Protection against coastal hazards such as"
"erosion  and  tsunamis  and  providing  a  green  cover  were  also  noted.  Moreover,  due  to  the  high  tourism"
"demand and visitor interest in nature and related ecosystems, a sustainable independent system capable"
of  generating  continuous  economic  benefits to the  community through tourist facilitation  could  be
"developed. In  turn,  the  sensitive  and  important  mangrove  habitats  that  are  mostly  found  in  lagoons,"
estuaries and wetlands  can  be  protected  sustainably  by  an  independent  tourism-centered system  and its
neighbouring stakeholders.

1.  Introduction
Mangrove is a type of forest growing along tidal mudflats and shallow coastal water areas extending along
rivers and streams where water is generally brackish. The mangrove ecosystem is dominated by mangrove
"trees as the primary producer interacting with associated aquatic fauna, and social and physical factors of"
the coastal environment. Distribution of mangroves species varies in countries and regions;
