Mangroves  possess  characteristics,that  collectively  make them  structurally  and functionally  unique.
"Morphological and ecophysiological characteristics and adaptations of mangrove trees include aerial roots,",
"viviparous embryos, tidal dispersal of propagules, rapid rates of canopy production, frequent absence of an",
"understorey,  absence  of  growth  rings,  wood  with  narrow,  densely  distributed  vessels,  highly  efficient",
"nutrient retention mechanisms, and the ability to cope with salt and to maintain water and  carbon balance",
"(Alongi,1998).",
B,"eing the only  woody halophytes living at the confluence of land and sea,  mangroves have been heavily"
"used traditionally for food, timber, fuel and medicine, and presently occupy about 181 000 km2 of tropical",
"and subtropical coastline (Alongi, 2002).",
M,angrove  plant  communities  are  a  comprehensive  economic  and  non-economic  contributor  to  mankind.
"Mangroves are a valuable ecological and economic resource, being an important nursery and breeding site",
"for birds, fish, crustaceans, shellfish, reptiles and mammals (Alongi, 2002 & Melana, 2000). Mangroves are",
"a  renewable  source  of  wood,  accumulation  sites  for  sediments,  contaminants,  carbon  and  nutrients,  and",
"protect  coastal  communities  against  coastal  erosion  (Liyanage,  2010).  Natural  hazards  such  as  storms,",
cyclones and most recently the Indian Ocean tsunami have repeatedly shown the value of mangroves and,
"the  need  to  prevent  unregulated,  destruction  and  extraction  by  man  (Melana,  2000).  Among  the  major",
reasons  for,"the  destruction  of  mangroves  are  urban  development,  aquaculture,  mining  and  the  over"
"exploitation of mangroves for timber, fish, crustaceans and shellfish. Over the next 30 years, unrestricted",
"clear felling, further development of aquaculture and the continuing overexploitation of fisheries will be the",
"greatest  threats.  Lesser threats  will  include alteration  of  hydrology,  pollution and global  warming.  Loss  of",
"mangrove  biodiversity  is,  and  will  continue  to  be,  a  severe  problem  as  even  pristine  mangroves  are",
"species-poor compared with other tropical ecosystems (Alongi, 2002).",

"due  to  a  lack  of  awareness,  knowledge  and  the  absence  of  systemic  tangible  benefits  at  the  community",

an enormous challenge. There is a pressing need to develop alternative conservation approaches that link,

"sustainable basis, by about 2030, the future of mangroves will depend on the development of technological",
