B,"ased on tourism initiatives in mangrove areas and lagoons, there will be non-economic benefits such as a",,,
"protected environment for breeding and nesting for birds, enabling the wetland ecosystems existence and",,,,
continuity  and  protection  for  rare  site  specific  fauna  species.  Use  of  mangrove  for  fire  wood  adversely,,,,
affects  all  non-economic  benefits;  it  can  also  lead  to  more  serious  environmental  issues  in  the  long  run.,,,,
Most of the community who collect (extract) fire wood from mangrove forest are not aware of the possible,,,,
environmental  problems.  Financial  difficulties  drive  them  to  use  fire  wood  for  cooking.  This  suggests  that,,,,
alternative sources of income may indirectly protect the mangroves and associated ecosystems.,,,,
C,"ontrolling the number of facility units in a given area, and number of visitors at a given time of the day will",,,
increase  the  financial  returns  to  the  community  without  harming  the  resource  base.  Income  generation,,,,
based on mangrove resources will provide the necessary motivation to protect the mangroves with minimal,,,,
"intervention. Linked with effective management methods this will be sustainable in the long run, and ensure",,,,
the environmental benefits of mangrove forests without any disruption.,,,,
