1.2 Sustainable tourism and mangrove conservation,,
"Sustainable tourism development requires the informed participation of all relevant stakeholders, as well as",,
strong  political  leadership  to  ensure  wide  participation  and  consensus  building.  Achieving  sustainable,,
tourism  is  a  continuous  process  that  requires  constant  monitoring  of  impacts  and  introducing  necessary,,
"preventive  and/or  corrective  measures,  whenever  necessary.  Sustainable  tourism  calls  for  maintaining  a",,
high level  of,tourist  satisfaction  and  ensuring  a  meaningful  experience,"to the tourists,  raising their"
awareness  about  sustainability,,issues  and  promoting  sustainable tourism  practices  amongst them.

cultural and economic issues.,,
T,"hus,  the  mangrove  environment  provides  a  comprehensive  nature  resource  base  as  a  foundation  to",
attract tourists. The  sustainability  concept  is  widely  discussed  at  present  in all  tourism  initiatives.  Coastal,,
"tourism  resource  bases particularly  the  mangrove  ecosystems,  a  vulnerable  and  sensitive  resource  base",,
"distributed  within  limited  areas  in  countries,  need  special  attention  for  its  long-term  existence.  Using",,
"sustainability concept as a tool and vehicle for careful utilisation of the coastal ecosystem, tourism has the",,
potential  to  help  conserve  mangroves  and  its  interrelated  ecosystems  by  providing  economic  gains  to,,
immediate  stakeholders,to  ensure,the  wider  non-economic  benefits  of  mangroves  (Liyanage  2010  &
Ratnayake 2007) .,,
I,"n  summary,  mangroves  are  a  unique  plant  species  that  contributes  direct  economic  benefits  and  even",
"more non-economic benefits to society. However, it appears that excepting conservators, others show little",,
regard  for  this  important  plant  family.  Mangroves  are  the  cradle  of  sea  and  lagoon  life  and  the  related,,
ecosystem.  Introducing  tourism  that  will  bring  economic  benefits  to  the  community  and  other  associated,,
"stakeholders will bring home the importance and value of mangroves for their livelihood, and motivate them",,
to protect mangroves.,,
