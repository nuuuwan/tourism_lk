Introduction
The
tourism
industry
is
highly
susceptible
to
crises
and
tourism
demand
is
strongly
influenced
by
the
economic,
social,
environmental,
health
and
political
aspects
of
a
destination
(and
source
markets)
.
Throughout
the
course
of
history,
the
tourism
industry
has
encountered
overwhelming
challenges,
with
the
COVID
-
19
pandemic
being
the
most
recent
challenge,
bringing
the
industry
almost
entirely
to
a
standstill
.
After
two
years
of
limited
recovery,
starting
in
September
2021
,
a
gradual
rebound
was
experienced
in
international
arrivals
to
Sri
Lanka
.
However,
the
latest
economic
crisis
has
started
to
impact
this
recovery
.
Therefore,
the
following
document
provides
an
analysis
of
arrivals
to
Sri
Lanka
from
August
2021
to
April
2022
to
understand
the
possible
impacts
of
the
economic
crisis
on
visitor
arrivals
.
The
repercussions
of
the
economic
crisis
have
started
to
spread
posing
real
challenges
to
how
Sri

tourism
industry
functions
and
delivers
on
the
visitor
experience
.
With
the
current
foreign
exchange
crisis
and
price
hikes
coupled
with
scarcity
of
essential
items
such
as
gas
and
petrol,
the
tourism
industry
in
Sri
Lanka
has
yet
another
challenge
to
navigate
.
The
full
supply
chain
of
the
industry
has
been
affected,
with
businesses
grappling
to
keep
up
their
daily
operations
.
Import
restrictions
imposed
due
to
the
foreign
exchange
crisis
has
further
caused
disruptions
in
the
supply
chain
and
ability
for
tourism
businesses
to
deliver
products,
services
and
experiences
to
tourists
.
Due
to
lower
supply
of
goods
and
high
consumer
demand,
inflation
has
ensued
with
prices
for
essential
goods
much
higher
.
These
issues
are
compounded
by
rolling
power
outages
.
The
very
likely
damage
to
Sri

international
tourism
brand
is
another
detrimental
effect
of
this
crisis
.
International,
mainstream
media
reports,
sometimes
exaggerating
the
situation
will
likely
result
in
negative
tourist
perceptions
and
could
lead
prospective
travellers
to
postpone
or
cancel
their
trips
.
A
number
of
Sri

top
source
markets
namely,
the
United
Kingdom,
Canada
and
New
Zealand
have
already
issued
Sri
Lankan
travel
advisories
to
their
citizens
.
Recent
market
research
shared
with
SLTDA
of
travel
consumers
in
the
20
largest
outbound
markets
points
to
the
importance
of
national
tourism
brands,
with
60
%
of
respondents
indicating
perceptions
of
destination
brands
drive
destination
choice
(Twenty
31
Consulting,
2021
)
.
While
Sri
Lanka
launched
a
new
brand
positioning
in
2019
,
there
has
been
limited
execution
of
this
brand
via
marketing,
communications,
PR
and
travel
trade
activities
.
There
is
some
imperative
now
for
Sri
Lanka
to
systematically
launch
this
brand
in
order
to
help
influence
the
narrative
and
build
travel
consumer
trust
.
The
current
challenges
in
Sri
Lanka
could
result
in
substitution
tourism,
as
seen
in
similar
crisis
around
the
world
.
However,
being
a
resilient
industry
tourism
will
bounce
back
as
previously
experienced
after
the
Easter
Attacks
in
2019
.
There
are
ample
examples
from
around
the
world
to
prove
the
resilient
nature
of
the
tourism
industry
and
its
ability
to
bounce
back
.
However,
being
in
the
wake
of
an
economic
recession
it
is
too
early
to
quantitatively
assess
its
impact
on
the
tourism
industry
and
Sri

tourism
economy
.
Nevertheless,
the
future
wellbeing
of
the
tourism
industry
will
depend
on
the
economic
and
political
stability
of
the
country
.
