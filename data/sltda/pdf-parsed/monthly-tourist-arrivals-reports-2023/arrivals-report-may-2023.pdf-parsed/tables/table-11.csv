,personalized and immersive travel experiences.,,,,,,,
,"Niche tourism in Sri Lanka can take various forms, including but not limited to eco-tourism, cultural",,,,,,,

,pay more for authentic and sustainable experiences.,,,,,,,
,Developing niche  tourism products  in  Sri Lanka  also  contributes to  the  overall sustainability  of  the,,,,,,,
,tourism sector.  Niche  tourism  tends to  have  a  smaller environmental  footprint  compared  to  mass,,,,,,,

,and cultural resources for future generations while reaping the economic benefits of tourism.,,,,,,,

,of natural and cultural resources.,,,,,,,
,The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the tourism industry in Sri Lanka. Prior to the,,,,,,,
,"pandemic,  tourism  played  a  vital  role  in  the  country's  economy,  contributing  to  foreign  exchange",,,,,,,
,"earnings, employment generation,  and overall economic  growth. However, the  arrival of  COVID-19",,,,,,,

,to GDP plummeted to a mere 0.8%. The closure of borders and travel restrictions resulted in a drastic,,,,,,,
,decrease in tourist arrivals and a decline in tourism-related activities.,,,,,,,
