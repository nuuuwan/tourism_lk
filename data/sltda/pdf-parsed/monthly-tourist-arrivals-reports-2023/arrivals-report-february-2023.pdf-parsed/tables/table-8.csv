"In February, the top five countries that generated the most international tourism to Sri Lanka"
"were the Russian Federation, India, the United Kingdom, Germany and France. The Russian"
"Federation  was  the  leading  source  of  tourists,  accounting  for  27%  of  total  arrivals.  India"
"accounted for 13%, the United Kingdom for  8%, Germany for 7%, and France for 6%. The"
"Russian Federation remained the top source of tourism to Sri Lanka, owing to increased air"
accessibility  via  direct  and  charter  flights  from  Russia  and  favorable  conditions  within  Sri
"Lanka. A comparison of tourist arrival numbers recorded for February 2022 ,reveals that  there"
"has  been  significant  growth  in  tourist  arrivals  for  the  Russian  Federation  (89.5),  Australia"
"(84.4), Canada (58.6), Israel (37.8), and the United States (31.7). It is worth noting that the"
"growth recorded for Russia and Israel is particularly significant, as tourist arrivals from these"
"countries  increased  by  123.5%  and  42.8%,  respectively,  compared  to pre-COVID  levels  in"
2019.
"On  the  other  hand,  there  has  been  a  decline  of  19.4%  in  tourist  arrivals  from  the  United"
Kingdom compared to February 2022. This decline could be attributed to factors such as a
"decrease in Sri Lankan diaspora visiting their friends and relatives, as well as a preference for"
"short-haul destinations such as Spain, Italy, and France."
"Overall, the growth in tourist arrivals for Russia and Israel and the decline in arrivals from the"
United  Kingdom  could  be  indicative  of  shifting  trends  in  outbound  travel  preferences  and
changes in diaspora travel patterns.
