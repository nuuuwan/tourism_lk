"During  July,  the  top  source  markets  to  Sri  Lanka  were  India,  United  Kingdom,  China,"
"Germany  and  Russia.  India  accounted  for  the  highest  percentage  of  arrivals  at  16%,"
"while the United Kingdom, China, Germany and Russia   represented 12%, 7%, 6% and"
6%  respectively.  These trends  indicate  changes in  outbound travel  preferences  and
"travel  patterns,  with  growth in  arrivals from India  and  United  Kingdom  and  China"
signaling a shift towards emerging destinations.
"The  improved  air  accessibility,  favorable  conditions  within  the  country,  proximity,  and"
geopolitical  factors  have  contributed  to  making  India  and  United  Kingdom  the  primary
source of tourism for Sri Lanka.
It's worth noting that the global and  local conditions have influenced the growth rates  of
"arrivals from different countries. While countries like  Russia,  China, India,  Maldives, and"
"Netherlands have shown substantial growth in arrivals, the United Kingdom and Canada"
"have exhibited  lowest growth  rates compared  to  June  2022, possibly  due to  emerging"
trends and responses to global and local conditions.
