"In  September, India  emerged  as the leading  source  of tourism for  Sri  Lanka,"
"contributing to 27% of total arrivals. China, the United Kingdom, Germany, and  Russia"
"followed  with  8%,  7%,  and  6%  each,  signifying  changing travel  preferences  and"
"patterns.  Notably, there  has  been  a rise in  arrivals from  China, Israel,  and the"
"Netherlands,  indicating a shift towards emerging destinations."
"Several factors, including improved  air  connectivity, favorable local conditions,"
"geographical proximity, and  geopolitical considerations,  have collectively  established"
these countries as Sri Lanka's primary tourism contributors.
The  growth  rates  of  tourist  arrivals  from  various  countries  have  been  influenced  by
"global  and local  dynamics.  Netherlands, Israel, India,  and  Russia  have  witnessed"
"substantial growth in arrivals, while Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia  have"
shown the slowest growth rates compared to September 2022. This variation in growth
rates can be attributed to evolving trends and responses to the prevailing global and
local circumstances.
