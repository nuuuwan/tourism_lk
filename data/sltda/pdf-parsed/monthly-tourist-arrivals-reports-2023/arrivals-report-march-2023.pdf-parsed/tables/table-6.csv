Note:  The  top  primary  markets  for  Sri  Lanka  have  been  identified  using  visitor  arrivals.  The  previous,,
methodology  used  to  identify  the  markets  was  altered  due  to  the  current  arrival  trends  in  the  source,,
markets and  the socio  economic factors  in Sri  Lanka. The  intention is  to track  these source  markets  on,,
"a  go-forward  basis  to  understand  future  performance  of  Sri  Lanka’s  tourism  economy,  including  during",,
"the projected  international  tourism  recovery  period,  2022-2025.",,
