Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report â€“ October 2023
Top ten markets versus main last departure airports
and main airlines to Sri Lanka
October 2023
Tourists' choices when it comes to airlines and departure airports are heavily influenced by their
"home countries. For instance, Indian travelers commonly choose Sri Lankan Airlines and IndiGo,"
"while Russian tourists tend to prefer Aeroflot and Red Wings. Conversely, Sri Lankan Airlines is"
"a  popular  choice  among  tourists  from  the  United  Kingdom,  Australia,  Maldives,  and  France."
"Notably, German, American, and Spanish tourists often opt for Qatar Airways and use Doha as"
their primary departure hub. Emirates is a favored option for both German and British tourists .
This  underscores  the  vital  importance  of  accessibility  in  boosting  tourism  in  Sri  Lanka.  It  also
emphasizes  that  tourists'  choices  regarding  airlines  and  departure  airports  are  significantly
"shaped by their home countries, highlighting the importance of convenient connections in drawing"
tourists to Sri Lanka.  With the return of  operations from airlines like  Turkish Airlines in  October
"and  the  introduction  of  other  charter  and  scheduled  flights  in  November,  including  Azur  Air,"
"Edelweiss, and Enter Air, the outlook for  connectivity and  an increase in tourists appears  more"
promising.
