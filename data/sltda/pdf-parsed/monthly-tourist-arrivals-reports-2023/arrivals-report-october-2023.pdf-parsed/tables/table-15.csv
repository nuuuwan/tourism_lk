War's Shadow:  The Impact of Israeli Conflict on Sri Lanka's Tourism
"Israelis are renowned for their adventurous and wanderlust-filled nature, always eager to venture beyond"
"their borders  to explore  the world,  embrace diverse  cultures, and  embark on  thrilling journeys.  Notably,"
"Israel's outbound travel sector has been experiencing remarkable growth. From 2010 to 2019, the number"
"of  Israeli  international  air  travel  increased  more  than  twofold,  surging  from  3.6  million  to  8.3  million,"
"reflecting an impressive average annual growth rate of 10%(Ketter, n.d)."
Israel stands out globally as a leader in the proportion of its population that seeks international adventures.
"Out of the approximately 9 million Israeli citizens, an astonishing 4.3 million took their travels overseas in"
"2019. The momentum continued into the first half  of 2023 (January to June), with Israelis embarking  on"
"4.5 million international journeys, surpassing the levels recorded in the previous peak year of 2019(Ketter,"
"n.d.).What's striking is the diversity in age groups represented among these travelers, with around 20% of"
"all international travelers from Israel being under the age of 20, underlining the broad appeal of outbound"
travel.
"However, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine has the potential to temporarily dissuade many"
adventure-seekers from pursuing their international  travel dreams for tourism.
"Israel plays a  pivotal role as  a source  of tourism for  Sri Lanka.  Yet, the ongoing  conflict between  Israel"
and Palestine holds the potential to exert a considerable influence on outbound tourism from Israel. It has
the capacity to discourage or interrupt the travel plans of Israeli  citizens.
"As of October 31, 2023, the total count of Israeli tourists who have journeyed to Sri Lanka stands at 18,909"
"while the arrivals recorded  for the month  of October was 460.  However, the daily  trend in tourist  arrival"
figures signals a gradual decline in the number of Israeli visitors as depicted in Chart 6.
