"In  August,  the  primary  source  markets  for  tourism  in  Sri  Lanka  were  India,  the  United"
"Kingdom, China, Germany, and Russia. India accounted for the largest share of arrivals"
"at 32%, while the United Kingdom, China, Germany, and Russia represented 15%, 10%,"
"9%,  and  7%  of  arrivals,  respectively.  These  trends indicate  shifts  in  outbound travel"
"preferences  and travel  patterns.  The  growth in  arrivals from  China, Italy  and  Spain"
signals a transition towards emerging destinations.
"Improved  air accessibility, favorable conditions  within the country, geographical"
"proximity, and geopolitical factors have jointly contributed to making  these countries the"
primary sources of tourism for Sri Lanka.
The  growth  rates  of tourist  arrivals from  different  countries  have  been  influenced  by
"global and local conditions. While Russia, China, and India have experienced significant"
"growth  in  arrivals,  the  United  Kingdom,  France,  and  Canada  have  demonstrated  the"
lowest  growth  rates  compared  to  August  2022.  This  disparity  in  growth  rates  may  be
attributed to emerging trends and responses to prevailing global and local conditions.
