First Experimental  Tourism Satellite  Account for Sri Lanka
"Sri  Lanka  stands  as  a  favored  destination  for  tourists  seeking  an  island  retreat,  offering  captivating  features  such  as"
"stunning  beaches,  rich  wildlife,  cultural  experiences,  and  traditional  healthcare  services.  This  thriving  tourism  sector"
not only  generates  income  and  livelihoods  but  also contributes  significantly  t o  foreign  exchange  earnings.  Despite  its
"evident  importance,  there  has  been  a  lack  of  information  regarding  its  specific  contribution  to  the  national  Gross"
"Domestic  Product  (GDP).  To  address  this  gap,  the  Sri  Lanka  Tourism  Development  Authority  (SLTDA)  ini tiated  a"
"study  aimed  at  establishing  the  country's  first  Tourism  Satellite  Account  (TSA),  aligning  with  international  guidelines"
set by the World Tourism  Organization.
"The  information  below  delineates  the  TSA  for  the  reference  year  2018,  recognizing  its  experimental  nature  due  to"
limitations in  available  data.  Despite  encountering  specific  challenges that impeded the  creation  of  an  all -
"encompassing  TSA,  this  inaugural  effort  has  played  a  crucial  role  in  surmounting  obstacles  for  subsequent  TSAs,"
with the  groundwork  for  this ongoing  process already  laid.
Inbound Tourism
"Data  utilized  for  the  estimation  of  Inbound  Tourism  Expenditure  was  derived  from  the  ""Survey  on  Departing  Foreign"
"Tourists""  (SDFT),  conducted  by  the  Sri  Lanka  Tourism  Development  Authority  (SLTDA)  from  January  to  December"
2018.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  primary  objective  of  conducting  SDFT-2018  was  to  gather  fundamental  tourism
"statistics, assess the  profile of tourists,  and understand  their travel patterns.  The survey was  not specifi cally  designed"
"to  cater to the requirements  of the  Tourism  Satellite  Account (TSA).  Consequently,  detailed information  on"
"expenditure related to tourism  products  and  services  was  not readily  available.  However, these  details  were"
approximated  using  the  existing  data  on  average  per-tourist  expenditure  and  the  distribution  of  various  expenditure
components  within  the total expenditure.  The  key findings  derived from  TSA  Table  1 are  outlined  below:
• The  average  non-package  per-tourist  and  per-night  expenditure  was  estimated to be  USD  181.15.
"• The broad  components, namely,  accommodation, transport  within country, eating  out activities,  shopping and  others"
"contributed  32.4  percent,  17.0  percent,  25.0  percent,  12.2  percent,  and  13.4  percent  respectively  to  the  t otal  non-"
package  tourism  expenditure.
• Converting the percentage  shares  to absolute  numbers  gave  the  breakup  of  USD  181.15.
• The  average  duration  of  stay for an  inbound  tourist is estimated at 11.15  nights.
"• The  estimated  number  of tourists arriving in Sri Lanka  in 2018,  is 2.33 million."
• The  multiplication  of  per-tourist expenditure  with  estimated  number of  tourists  and  average duration  of  stay  gave  the
estimated  values  of  expenditure  in USD  terms. This  worked  out  to be USD  4713.77.
•  On  further  multiplying  this  with  the  USD  to  LKR  exchange  rate  gave  the  inbound  non-package  tourism  expenditure
as LKR 766150.
"•  Further,  share  of  non-package  tours  in  total  is  estimated  to  be  83  percent.  Accordingly,  total  inbound  expenditure"
"(including  both package  and  non-package  components)  worked  out to be  LKR 923,072  million."
•  The  broad  components  were  mapped  with  the  TSA  products  and  services  and  using  the  proportions  as  seen  in
"domestic tourism  expenditure  for  these  products  and  services, the  inbound  tourism  expenditure  was  estimated  for  all"
"products  and  services.  Hence,  TSA  Table  1 could  be prepared  for  Sri Lanka  Experimental  TSA."
•  The  table  reveals  that  27.6  percent  of  total  inbound  tourism  expenditure  was  incurred  on  food  and  beverage.  This
"was  followed  by  land  transport  services,  and  Accommodation  services  accounting  for  22.5  percent  and  17.8  percent"
respectively.
•  The  inbound  tourists  spent  about  22  percent  of  their  total  expenditure  on  Country -specific  goods  and
services.
"• The  per-tourist  inbound  expenditure  is estimated at LKR  395,524."
