,Domestic  Tourism
,"To  estimate the  domestic tourism expenditure,  data  was obtained  from  Sri Lanka  Tourism  Expenditure  Survey"
,"(SLTES),  conducted  by Department  of  Census  and  Statistics (DCS)  for  the year  2017-18  (Oct 2017  to Aug"
,"2018).  The  domestic tourism  expenditure  was  collected at fairly  disaggregated  level.  Hence,  the TSA  Table  2"
,on  Domestic Tourism  Expenditure  could be  prepared  directly from  the survey  findings.
,The  key findings  are  as follows:
,"Total  domestic tourism  expenditure  is estimated at LKR  38,255  million."
,"Of  the total domestic tourism expenditure,  the highest, at 37.2  percent,  is spent on  country -specific  goods."
,Land  passenger  transport  is the popular  mode  of transport  among  both  inbound  and  domestic tourists . Food
,and  beverage  account  for  17.9  percent  and  all other  products  and  services  account  for  only 13.7  percent  of  total
,domestic expenditure.
,"The  average  per-tourist  expenditure  is estimated  at LKR  5475.  Among  the different  purposes  for  travel,  the"
,"highest  per-tourist  expenditure  is recorded  for  a holiday/leisure  trip, at LKR 8837.  On  the other  hand,  a  health"
,"trip turns  out to be the least expensive,  at LKR 4242."
,Outbound  Tourism
,"In  the case of  Sri Lanka,  there  is no  data on  outbound  tourism  expenditure.  Hence  this part  of  the tourism"
,expenditure  cannot  be  presented  in the experimental  TSA.
,Total Internal Tourism  Expenditure
,The  summation  of Inbound  and  Domestic  Tourism  Expenditure  is the Total  Internal  Tourism  Expenditure  for  Sri
,Lanka.  This  table shows  that:
,"The  Sri Lankan  tourism  economy is driven  by inbound  tourism, which  contributes  as much as 96 percent  to total"
,tourism expenditure.
,Inbound  tourism accounts for  more  than  90 percent  of  expenditure  on almost all the tourism  related  products
,"and  services,  except water  transport  services,  country-specific  goods, and  other  consumer  goods  and  services,"
,"for  which  domestic tourism  makes up for  21  percent,  and  11.6  percent  each respectively."
,The  per-tourist  expenditure  incurred  in the case of  inbound  trip in Sri Lanka  is over  72  times more  than that of  a
,domestic trip.
,Supply Side data
,The  supply side data  for  tourism  specific industries  was obtained  from  Sri Lanka’s  Supply and  Use  Table  (SUT)
,for  2018  prepared  by Department  of  Census  and  Statistics (DCS)  Sri Lanka. These  data  are  presented  in TSA
,"Table  5. In  the core  TSA Table,  that is, Table  6, the demand  side data  and  supply side were  brought  together,"
,as per  the recommended  guideline.
,Tourism  Satellite Account
,"Tourism  Direct Gross  Value  Added  (TDGVA)  is estimated to be  LKR 467,975  million  for  2018,  or  3.34 percent"
,"of  national  GVA (LKR  14,014,197  million)."
,"In  terms of  GDP, Tourism  Direct GDP  (TDGDP)  is estimated at LKR  512,645  million. The  total Gross  Domestic"
,"Product  for  2018  was  LKR 15,351,933  million. Hence,  the contribution  of  TDGDP  to national  GDP  is also"
,estimated  at 3.34  percent.
,"This  refers  to the direct share  of  tourism to Sri Lanka  economy,  as per  the country’s first experimental  TSA."
