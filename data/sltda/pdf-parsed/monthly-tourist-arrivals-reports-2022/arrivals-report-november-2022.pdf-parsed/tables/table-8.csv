The impact of visa facilitation on tourism industry,
"In an era where COVID-19 pandemic brought about sweeping changes on the travel behaviour,",
"easing the movement of people, especially the tourists is vital to revive the tourism industry,",
battered by an unprecedent crisis. Facilitating travel is an essential step to kick start not only,
the tourism industry  but  also the  other  crucial,industries  that  are  vital to  an  economy.
"Accordingly, many countries around the globe have introduced various methods in terms of",
visa facilitation to reduce the barriers and bottlenecks that limit the movement of tourists that,
are crucial for their economies. The recent initiative by Sri Lankan Government to relax visa,
regulations  and  extended  stay  allowance  from  30  days  to  between  180  and  270  days  is  a,
"welcoming gesture  to the  tourism  industry,  that  is  awaiting  a  boost.  In  addition,  the  visa  on",
arrival facility introduced to Indian tourists is another recent initiative targeted to facilitate and,
"bolster the industry. Though not directly related to tourism, the Golden Paradise Resident Visa",
programme for investors is another recent initiative taken by Sri Lanka in an effort to motivate,
more investments in to the island.,
The flow of people across national borders is governed by the entry policies of countries. While,
"some  countries/regions  practice  open  visa  policies,  other  countries  practice  stringent  visa",
"policies.  Therefore,  it  is  vital  to  dwell  on  the  purpose  of  visa  in  order  to  understand  the",
importance of it to a country. Among an array of functions visas are considered as an important,
"tool for security, immigration control, limitation of entry, duration of stay and activities. On the",
"other hand, visas also provide a means of raising revenue for the State.  In addition, Visa policy",
"can also be defined by a country’s law or national prerogatives. In some cases, a country will",
impose a visa on another because the other country requires a visa of the issuing country’s,
"citizens  –  a  policy  known  as  ‘reciprocity’.  In  addition,  visas  can  be  used  as  an  incentive  to",
encourage  support  of  a  country’s  foreign  policy  or  retaliation  in  the  case  of  disagreement.,
Further countries use visas to limit the number of tourists to their country for capacity reasons,
"(WTTC & UNWTO, 2012).",
"Over the past decade, international travel has been supported by considerable changes in visa",
facilitation.  The  percentage  of  travellers  required  to  obtain  a  traditional  visa  has  decreased,
from 77% in 2008 to 53% in 2018 and reciprocal traditional visa restrictions have fallen from,
57% to 22% in the same period. A shift has taken place from traditional visas (where one must,
"apply in person at an embassy) to visa-on-arrival (from 6% to 16%), electronic, or e-visa (from",
0% to 10%) and the removal of visas altogether (from 17% to 21%) between 2008 and 2018.,
"As at August 2019, South East Asia, Oceania and East Africa are the most open destinations;",
"whereas  North America,  Central  Africa  and  North Africa  remain the  most  restrictive regions",
"(WTTC, 2019). As per the findings of UNWTO & WTTC in 2011 Turkey, Mexico, and Australia",
"have the most open visa policies towards their current source markets with just 3%, 4%, and",
"4% of tourists requiring visas. In 2015, the Indonesian government introduced a 30-day visa",
"waiver  for  the  majority  of  source markets,  mostly  replacing  its  visa  on-arrival.  The  resulting",
growth in annual visitor arrivals increased from 9.0% in the three years prior to 2015 to 15.5%,
in 2016 and an estimated 22% in 2017. The policy effectively led to a 24% uplift (8% p.a.) in,
inbound  demand  which  in  turn  is  responsible  for  6%  of  employment  supported  by  Travel  &,
"Tourism or 400,000 jobs. In 2014, the government of India introduced an e Visa for over 40",
"markets, which was then extended to cover the bulk of source markets in 2015. Following the",
"change in visa policy, the growth in international arrivals accelerated from 5.8% in the three",
years prior to 2014 to 10% in 2016 and an estimated 15% in 2017. This figure contrasts with,
the  counterfactual  growth  of  3.3%  average  growth  should,the  policy  not  have  been
"implemented  (WTTC,  2019)  Under  the  USA  Visa  Waiver  Program  Expansion  (2008)  USA",
