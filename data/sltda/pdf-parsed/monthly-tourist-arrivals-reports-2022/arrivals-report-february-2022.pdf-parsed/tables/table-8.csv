,The impact of Ukraine crisis on Sri Lanka Tourism
,The travel industry that was battered by COVID 19 and related conditions in the last two years
,"was  gradually  reinvigorating  and  was  anticipating  a  boom,  when  again  faced  with  another"
,shock  and  uncertainty  with  the  crisis  in  Ukraine.  This  will  result  in  serious  implications  for
,"destinations  including  Sri  Lanka,  that  rely  on  Eastern  European  markets  for  their  inbound"
tourism.,
,Russians  and  Ukrainians  are  known  and  valued  for  their  resilient  nature  in  terms  of  travel
,"behaviour and longer duration of stay. In 2019, Russian travelers have taken more than 40"
million,"trips,  becoming  one  of the fast  growing  outbound  markets  as the  sixth  highest"
,"international visitor spending (Grima, 2022)The expenditure per day (non-package excluding"
,air fare) of a Russian tourist in Sri Lanka was about USD 162.94 for the year 2018 while an
,expenditure per day of USD 164.24 had been recorded for a Ukrainian tourist (The survey on
,"Departing  Foreign  Tourists,  2018).  Ukrainians  were  the first  batch  of  tourists  to  arrive  in  Sri"
,Lanka during the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2020 and Russia was among the top ten
,"source  markets  of  Sri  Lanka.  According  to  Forwardkeys,  prior  to  the  invasion,  Russian"
,"outbound flight bookings for March to May had recovered to 32% of pre-pandemic levels, with"
,some holiday hotspots doing exceptionally well. Sri Lanka had occupied the 10th position (with
,a share of 7%) among the top 20 most booked destinations by Russians for the period of March
,"to May 2022(Hamdi, 2022). Russian tourist arrivals recorded for the year 2020 and 2021 are"
,"49, 397 and 16,894 respectively. While 17,169 and 7,037 Ukrainian tourist arrivals had been"
,12
,recorded for  the  consecutive  years  of  2020  and  2021  respectively.  This  growth momentum
,"continues to 2022, with 28, 818 total Russian arrivals and 13,062 Ukrainian arrivals recorded"
,"from 1st of January to 28th February, exceeding pre pandemic levels. The tourism reopening"
,"time  in  Sri  Lanka  in  comparison  to  other  similar  destinations  such  as  Thailand,  promotion"
,initiatives  with  Russia  and  initiation  of  direct  flights  could  be  attributed  as  the  main  factors
,behind this growth since October 2021.
,"Given the importance of especially the Russian market, the implications of this crisis will be far"
,reaching for Sri Lanka tourism especially for a prolonged period of time. As voiced by several
,"major travel agents in Sri Lanka, they are already getting cancellations from Russian tourists"
,"and no new bookings had been received. Accordingly, following factors can be pointed out as"
,major impediments in relation to outbound travel and prolonged absence of tourists especially
,from Russia and Ukraine that in turn will affect Sri Lanka tourism.
•,Devaluation of Rouble which has plunged by 30 percent against the Dollar. This will
,crimp the spending power of Russian travelers.
•,The  impact  of  declared  sanctions  against  Russia  and  the  adverse  impact  on  the
,"economy. The West is already pushing international companies to halt sales, cut ties,"
,and dump tens of billions of dollars’ worth of investments in Russia.
•,The removal of Russia’s central bank and other Russian banks from the SWIFT global
,payments system
•,Disrupted flights
,Russia’s airspace is the popular overflight for EU flights en route to Asia. As highlighted
,by  Bloomberg  and  CNN  the  European  Union  have  closed  all  airspace  across  its  27
,countries  to  Russian  airplanes  by  Sunday  and  Russia  has  reciprocated  with  its  own
,"bans, causing airlines to fly circuitous intercontinental routes. This will have implications"
,for other European markets as well. European carriers going in the other direction face
