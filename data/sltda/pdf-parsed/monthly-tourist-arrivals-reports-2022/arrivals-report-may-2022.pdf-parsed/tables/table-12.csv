ourist arrivals by purpose of visit
May 2022
An  analysis  of  tourist  arrivals  by  purpose  of  visit  reveals  that  a  majority  (48%)  of
"tourists had visited Sri Lanka for pleasure/vacation, while for 33% of tourists the main"
"purpose  was  visiting  friends  and  relatives.  In  comparison  to  April  2022,  the  tourists"
who had visited Sri Lanka for pleasure/vacation purposes had decreased while tourists
who had come for VFR purposes had increased. The reason could be the expatriates
as 75% of arrivals from Canada  and 70% of arrivals from Australia were for the purpose
of  visiting  friends and relatives. Only 5%  of  tourists  had  visited  for  business  related
"purposes.  1%  had  visited  for  health  related  purposes,  while  0.1%  had  visited  for"
purposes such as sports and education.
