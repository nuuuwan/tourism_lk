Note: The top primary markets for Sri Lanka have been identified using visitor arrivals data during the,,
last six months. The previous methodology used to identify the markets was altered due to the current,,
arrival trends in the source markets and the economic crisis in Sri Lanka. The intention is to track these,,
"source markets on a go-forward basis to understand future performance of Sri Lankaâ€™s tourism economy,",,
"including during the projected international tourism recovery period, 2022-2025.",,
