,last six months. The previous methodology used to identify the markets was altered due to the current,,
,arrival trends in the source markets and the economic crisis in Sri Lanka. The intention is to track these,,
,source  markets  on  a  go-forward  basis  to  understand  future  performance  for  Sri  Lankaâ€™s  tourism,,
,"economy, including during the projected international tourism recovery period, 2022-2025.",,
