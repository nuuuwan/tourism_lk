N,"ote: The top primary markets for Sri Lanka have been identified using visitor arrivals data, during the",,
last eight months. The previous methodology used to identify the markets was altered due to the current,,,
arrival trends in the source markets and the economic and other conditions in Sri Lanka. The intention,,,
is to track these source markets on a go-forward basis to understand future performance for Sri Lankaâ€™s,,,
"tourism economy, including during the projected international tourism recovery period, 2022-2025.",,,
