As pointed out by Shankman (2013) Visiting friends and relatives is the primary reason for travel for 20 percent
of travellers in Asia. This segment is becoming more important as immigrant and expat communities grow in
Asia Pacific destinations. In her analysis of VFR travel to India from Australia Shankman revealed that it is an
important segment with a contribution of 43% and is becoming a emerging traveller type that will define the
future of the industry.
