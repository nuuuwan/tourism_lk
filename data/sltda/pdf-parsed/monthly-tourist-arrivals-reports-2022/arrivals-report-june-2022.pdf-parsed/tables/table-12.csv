ourist arrivals by purpose of visit
June 2022
An analysis of tourist arrivals by purpose of visit reveals that a majority (41%) of tourists had
"visited Sri Lanka for visiting friends and relatives, while for 38% of tourists the main purpose"
"was pleasure/vacation. In comparison to April 2022, the tourists who had visited Sri Lanka for"
pleasure/vacation purposes had decreased while tourists who had come for VFR purposes
had increased. The reason could be the expatriates who are visiting their friends & relatives
as 83% of arrivals from Canada  and 61% of arrivals from Australia were for the purpose of
VFR. Only 6% of tourists had visited for business related purposes. 1% had visited for health
"related purposes, while 1% and 0.02% had visited for purposes such as sports and education."
