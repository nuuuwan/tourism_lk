The above chart 1 clearly shows the gradual decline experienced in arrivals in the month of April with the
"onset of the economic crisis and its related conditions. However, a gradual increase and a stabilisation in"
tourists arrivals was evident since the mid May and this could be owing to the temporary political stabilization
"and related conditions that created somewhat favourable environment. Thus, unlike in previous months the"
"majority of these tourist arrivals did not constitute pleasure travellers, yet it constituted travellers who visited"
for VFR purposes.
"As depicted in the chart 3 & 4, out of total arrivals in the month of June, the VFR constituted 41.4% while"
"arrivals  from  the  United  Kingdom,  Australia  and  Canada  constituted  70%,  61%  and  83%  VFR  arrivals"
respectively. India recorded 25.5% VFR arrivals while Germany recorded 38%.
The motive behind VFR travellers is created by a strong feeling to reconnect with their families and reaffirm
"their roots in their hometowns. Especially after a prolonged period of separation due to the pandemic, the"
need  to  reconnect  with  their  families  and  friends  have  become  stronger  than  ever  before.  Even  though
"platforms such as Zoom, Facebook, Wats App bridged the gap virtually, the need to join physically with the"
loved ones have created a strong demand for VFR travel.
"When it comes to inbound VFR travel to Sri Lanka, the factors such as the easing of travel restrictions such"
as the elimination of PCR tests and the mandatory travel insurance could be the motivating factors for this
segment to visit their relatives and friends in Sri Lanka. Given the current political and economic crisis in Sri
"Lanka, VFR travel could be a viable market segment for forex crisis too. Unlike pleasure travellers, the VFR"
travellers are much familiar with the country and equipped with the knowledge to involve in tourism related
"activities even during a difficult situation. Therefore, focusing on VFR segment as a source of tourism would"
be an ideal contemporary solution.
"As per the findings of Nielsen Global Trust, 83% (qtd. in Global Data) of consumers trust recommendations"
from friends and family more than any other form of marketing. Given the nature of  forex crisis currently
faced in Sri Lanka activating the VFR market leverages the most powerful marketing tool available: Word
"of Mouth (WOM), which is free of charge. Further, research also provided strong evidence that the VFR"
"market is less affected by seasonality and external threats than other segments. Thus, in an off-peak season"
"starting from May to October, VFR segment could be an ideal segment for a destination like Sri Lanka to"
"target. With the travel advisories issued by main source markets like the United Kingdom and others, VFR"
segment could be the only resilient segment under the given social and economic conditions in Sri Lanka.
