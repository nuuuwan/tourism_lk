"Targeting VFR segment as a viable source for Sri Lanka Tourism 
 
 
 
 
Visiting  friends  and  relatives  (VFR)  has  become  an  important  and  unique  segment  of  the  inbound  visitor 
economy over recent years and has been identified as a segment with many economic benefits and with great 
potential worldwide though they have been underestimated compared to pleasure market.  
As revealed in many research studies there are several different reasons for the growth in the visiting friends 
and  relatives  market  around  the  world.  This  includes  globalization,  a  growing  expat  population,  migration, 
freedom of movement, education and the desire to travel. (Tourism Teacher,2020) The VFR market offers a 
useful range of additional benefits for destinations looking to grow their visitor economy in a sustainable way 
(DMS,n.d). 
1. They are more willing to travel outside of peak season, making them a perfect audience for any destination 
looking to ‘top-up’ their visitor numbers in the low or shoulder seasons. Balancing out business opportunities, 
year-round. 
2. They tend to stay longer than other visitors: 60% stay for seven days or longer (Source: My Travel Research). 
3. They are more likely to be repeat visitors; making, on average, between two to three VFR-related visits every 
year (Source: Elisa Backer and Brian King). 
4. For a variety of reasons, the VFR market are frequent users of commercial accommodation. 
As per the forecasts of Global Data, visiting friends and relatives (VFR) travel will experience higher growth, 
with a 17% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2021-25, compared to leisure, growing at a 16.4% 
increase between the same time period.",,12

As pointed out by Shankman (2013) Visiting friends and relatives is the primary reason for travel for 20 percent 
of travellers in Asia. This segment is becoming more important as immigrant and expat communities grow in 
Asia Pacific destinations. In her analysis of VFR travel to India from Australia Shankman revealed that it is an 
important segment with a contribution of 43% and is becoming a emerging traveller type that will define the 
future of the industry.  
Similarly Visiting friends and relatives travel can be considered as a significant market segment for Sri Lanka 
Tourism as vividly depicted in the arrival data since the month of May.",,
