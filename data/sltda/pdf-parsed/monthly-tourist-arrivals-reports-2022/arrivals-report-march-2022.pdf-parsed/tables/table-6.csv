Note: The top primary markets for Sri Lanka have been identified using a combination of historical visitor,,,
"arrivals data, total outbound market size data, overall size of the economy, recent consumer sentiment",,,
data  and  other  variables.  The  intention  is  to  track  these  source  markets  on  a  go-forward  basis  to,,,
understand,future  performance for  Sri  Lankaâ€™s,"the  projected tourism  economy, including  during",
"international  tourism  recovery  period,  2022-2025  (source:  Pacific  Asia  Travel  Association,  January,",,,
2021).,,,
* A prolonged absence of Ukrainian and Russian tourists is anticipated due to the current conflict and its longterm,,,
"implications. Accordingly, Russia is unlikely to be a primary market for Sri Lanka from February onwards.",,,
