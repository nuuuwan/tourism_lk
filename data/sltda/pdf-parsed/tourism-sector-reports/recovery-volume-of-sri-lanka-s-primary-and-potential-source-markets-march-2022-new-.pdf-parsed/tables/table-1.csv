Introduction
"As a dynamic industry, subject to market shifts and geo-political events, tourism is also known for its ability to bounce back, even despite the"
heaviest blows such as the most recent COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout history both human made and natural disasters have inflicted severe
impacts  on  the  tourism  industry.  Yet  the  industry  has  almost  always  recovered  back  and  continues  to  provide  real  benefits  to  national  and
"regional economies and local communities. This is true for Sri Lanka’s tourism economy too. Among such setbacks, the Easter attacks in 2019,"
the on-going COVID- 19 pandemic and the massive decline in outbound travel due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 can be considered
as the most recent incidents that have hindered tourism.
"A protracted recovery is a very likely scenario for Sri Lanka and will unfold at least until 2025. Within this context, Sri Lanka Tourism Development"
Authority’s Research and International Relations Department continues to analyse these issues and the potential impact on Sri Lanka’s in-bound
tourism  arrivals  and  overall  tourism  economy.    The  following  report  provides  a  snapshot  of  recent  arrivals  to  Sri  Lanka  and  an  analysis  of
growth/decline rates to determine priority markets likely to support recovery.
"The rate of recovery has been calculated by dividing the average tourist arrivals for the period from October 21 to January 2022, by the average"
"tourist arrivals from October 2018 to January 2022, and multiplying by hundred. The period from October to January was selected as this is"
"typically recorded as the peak months for Sri Lanka tourism. Further, the year 2018 was considered for this comparison as it can be considered"
as a peak year for tourism arrivals and a ‘normal’ year for Sri Lanka tourism.
"A closer look at the recovery rates reveals that Russia, Poland, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Czech Republic and India are the key source markets with"
the  highest  recovery  rates  (note:  this  analysis  was  conducted  prior  to  Russia’s  invasion  of  Ukraine  and  the  implementation  of  economic
"sanctions). Given the current crisis in Ukraine and the political and economic repercussions for Russia, Ukraine and possibly Russia will not"
"likely be a main source markets for a protracted period of time. Canada, Austria, Switzerland, France, Germany, Spain, Norway, United States"
"and the United Kingdom are the source markets with a moderate recovery level. Portugal, UAE, Australia, Sweden, Finland and Singapore can"
"be considered as source markets with a slow recovery rate, while the slowest recovery rates are recorded from Italy, South Korea, Thailand,"
"Netherland, South Africa, Malaysia, Japan, Taiwan and China."
