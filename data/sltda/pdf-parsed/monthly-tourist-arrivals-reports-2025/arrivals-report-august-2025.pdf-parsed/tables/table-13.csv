Tourist arrivals by purpose of visit
August 2025
Tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka in August demonstrated the country's continued strength as
"a premier leisure destination, with visitor arrival data revealing distinct travel patterns and"
market opportunities.
"Out  of  the  total  198,235  arrivals,  a  majority  of  117,404  tourists,  accounting  for  (59.22"
"percent),  visited  the  country for pleasure  and  vacation  purposes. This  underscores  Sri"
"Lanka’s  strong  positioning  as  a leisure  destination,  driven  by its  cultural  heritage,"
"beaches, wildlife, and natural landscapes. The fact that nearly six out of every ten tourists"
fall  into  this  category  highlights  the  central  role  leisure  plays  in  sustaining  the  tourism
industry.
"Visiting Friends and Relatives (VFR) is another important segment, comprising 20,630"
"arrivals, or (10.41 percent) of the total. This figure reflects the strong presence of the Sri"
"Lankan diaspora abroad and their role in sustaining inbound travel. Meanwhile, Meetings,"
"Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (MICE) contributed 14,885 tourists,"
representing (7.51 percent). This is a significant share that highlights the potential of Sri
"Lanka to grow further as a business and events destination, particularly with improved"
infrastructure and marketing.
"Smaller  but  noteworthy  segments include  business travel  with  4,498  arrivals  (2.27"
"percent),  health  and  ayurvedic  tourism  with  673  arrivals  (0.34  percent),  and  religious"
tourism with 553 arrivals (0.28 percent). sports and education related visits remain very
"low,  at  only  244  (0.12  percent)  and  239  (0.12  percent),  respectively.  While these"
"categories  contribute  minimally  at  present, they  offer  opportunities for  growth if"
"strategically developed, given Sri Lanka’s strengths in wellness, cultural heritage, sports"
"events, and academic exchanges."
"Overall, the analysis suggests that Sri Lanka remains predominantly a leisure destination,"
though diaspora related travel and MICE tourism also play significant roles. The smaller
segments remain underutilized but provide scope for diversification of the tourism product
"base. While reinforcing the country’s leisure appeal, greater emphasis should be placed"
"on  diversifying  into  high  value  niche  markets  such  as  wellness,  religious,  sports,  and"
"education tourism, alongside strengthening diaspora linkages and MICE opportunities."
