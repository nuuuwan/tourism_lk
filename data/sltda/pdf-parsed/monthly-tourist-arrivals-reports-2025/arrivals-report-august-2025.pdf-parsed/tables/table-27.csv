Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report August 2025
The Chinese and Japanese markets demonstrate a strong preference for transit hubs within
"Asia rather than the Middle East. For Chinese tourists, the primary points of departure are"
"Shanghai (2,910) and Hong Kong (1,426), with significant numbers also traveling via Kuala"
"Lumpur (1,088) and Bangkok (599). Similarly, Japanese tourists most frequently used Kuala"
"Lumpur (635), Bangkok (585), and Singapore (491), with direct connections from Shanghai"
(511) also playing a role. This highlights the importance of Southeast Asian hubs and regional
carriers for East Asian travel flows.
"Finally, the Australian market displays the most unique and focused routing. The data shows"
"an  overwhelming  dependence  on  a  single  hub:  Singapore.  A  massive  (2,663)  Australian"
"tourists transited through Singapore, a number that dwarfs the second most popular option,"
"the direct connection from Melbourne (2,151). This clearly establishes Singapore Airlines as"
"the carrier of choice for Australian visitors, with very few opting for Middle Eastern or other"
"transit points, illustrating a highly streamlined travel corridor between Australia and Sri Lanka"
via Singapore.
