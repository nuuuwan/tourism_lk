Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report August 2025
"for a staggering combined market share of over 37%, underscoring the indispensable role"
"of  hubs  like  Doha,  Dubai,  and  Abu  Dhabi  in  connecting  Sri  Lanka  to  source  markets"
"across Europe, the Americas, and Africa."
A particularly striking insight is the remarkable performance of the Indian low cost carrier
"Indi Go, which captured a 12.06% market share with 23,906 passengers. This makes it"
"the  third  largest  airline,  even  surpassing  Emirates  in  volume.  This  figure  powerfully"
emphasizes the immense volume of traffic from India and the successful penetration of a
low cost model catering to price sensitive tourists and visitors. Other key players include
"Air India, which holds a 5.80% share, reinforcing the strong air links with the subcontinent,"
"and Turkish Airlines, whose 3.21% share confirms its growing role as a key connector"
from  Europe  and  other  regions.  The  presence  of  Chinese  carriers  like  China  Eastern
"(2.59%) and Air China (1.04%) caters to the important Chinese market, while Southeast"
Asian  airlines  such  as  Singapore  Airlines  (2.13%)  and  Air  Asia  (1.97%)  serve  their
"respective  hubs.  The  remaining  traffic  is  divided  among  carriers  like  Fits  Air,  Cathay"
"Pacific, and others, which collectively account for the final 4.2% of arrivals."
The  strategic  implications  of  this  market  structure  are  significant.  Sri  Lanka's  tourism
"industry,  while  benefiting  from  its  strong  national  carrier,  is  notably  dependent  on  the"
"capacity and routing strategies of foreign airlines, particularly the powerful Middle Eastern"
conglomerates.  The  extraordinary  success  of  IndiGo  points  to  a  major  opportunity  for
"further deepening ties with the Indian travel market through low cost carriers. Ultimately,"
this  data  serves  as  a  crucial  tool  for  understanding  the  competitive  dynamics  of  the
aviation sector and identifying the key airline partnerships that are most vital for bringing
tourists to the country.
