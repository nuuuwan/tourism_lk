Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report August 2025
"reflecting the importance of the Singapore hub. For Japan, Sri Lankan Airlines (51.57%)"
"is also the leading carrier, but a significant portion of traffic is distributed among East Asian"
"carriers like China Eastern (10.10%), Air Asia (8.89%), and Singapore Airlines (5.89%),"
indicating the use of regional hubs like Shanghai and Singapore for connectivity.
"In direct contrast, long haul markets from Europe are overwhelmingly dependent on the"
"big  three  Middle  Eastern  carriers  (Qatar  Airways,  Emirates,  and  Etihad  Airways)  and"
"Turkish Airlines. For instance, the United Kingdom spreads its traffic across Sri Lankan"
"Airlines (31.27%), Qatar Airways (25.86%), and Emirates (17.75%). This pattern is even"
more pronounced for continental European nations. Germanyâ€™s arrivals are heavily reliant
"on  Qatar  Airways  (26.80%),  Emirates  (19.82%),  and  Etihad  Airways  (16.32%).  France"
"uses a similar mix, while Italy and Spain show a particularly strong preference for Etihad"
Airways (20.07% and 22.85% respectively) and Turkish Airlines (9.46% and 17.04%). The
"Netherlands presents the most extreme case of Middle Eastern hub dependency, with a"
massive 32.59% share for Qatar Airways and 26.77% for Emirates. The national carrier
"holds  a  much  smaller  share  in  these  European  markets,  underscoring  the  competitive"
power of the Gulf hubs.
"The Chinese market stands alone with a unique pattern, being the only one dominated by"
its own national carriers rather than Middle Eastern or Sri Lankan airlines. China Eastern
"Airlines  is  the  clear  leader  with  a  34.07%  share,  followed  by  Air  China  (16.16%).  This"
indicates  that  a  majority  of  Chinese  tourists  arrive  via  direct  flights  or  through  Chinese
hubs. The remaining traffic is split among other Asian carriers like Cathay Pacific (11.49%)
"and Air Asia (5.05%), with Sri Lankan Airlines capturing a modest 14.82% of this market."
"In conclusion, this data is vital for strategic planning. It shows Sri Lankan Airlines' solid"
position in the South Asian and East Asian markets but also its significant vulnerability to
the competitive pricing and extensive networks of the Middle Eastern giants in its valuable
European  source  markets.  The  overwhelming  preference  for  specific  airlines  in  each
region  provides  a  clear  roadmap  for  targeted  marketing  campaigns  and  commercial
"partnerships,  suggesting  that  tourism  authorities  should  collaborate  closely  with  Qatar"
"Airways for the Dutch and German markets, with Etihad for Italian and Spanish tourists,"
and with Singapore Airlines for the Australian market to maximize arrival numbers.
