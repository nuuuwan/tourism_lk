GLOBAL CODE OF ETHICS
FOR TOURISM
adopted by resolution A/RES/406(XIII) at
the thirteenth WTO General Assembly

(Santiago, Chile, 27 September -

1 October 1999).
PREAMBLE
We, Members of the World Tourism
Organization (WTO), representa-

tives of the world tourism industry,

delegates of States, territories,

enterprises, institutions and bodies

that are gathered for the General

Assembly at Santiago, Chile on this

first day of October 1999,
Reasserting
the aims set out in Article
3 of the Statutes of the World Tourism

Organization, and aware of the ﬁdeci-

sive and centralﬂ role of this

Organization, as recognized by the

General Assembly of the United

Nations, in promoting and developing

tourism with a view to contributing to

economic development, international

understanding, peace, prosperity and

universal respect for, and observance

of, human rights and fundamental

freedoms for all without distinction as

to race, sex, language or religion,
Firmly believing
that, through the
direct, spontaneous and non-media-

tized contacts it engenders between

men and women of different cultures

and lifestyles, tourism represents a

vital force for peace and a factor of

friendship and understanding among

the peoples of the world,
In keeping
with the rationale of rec-
onciling environmental protection,

economic development and the fight

against poverty in a sustainable man-

ner, as formulated by the United

Nations in 1992 at the ﬁEarth Summitﬂ

of Rio de Janeiro and expressed in

Agenda 21, adopted on that occasion,
Taking into account
the swift and con-
tinued growth, both past and foresee-

able, of the tourism activity, whether

for leisure, business, culture, religious

or health purposes, and its powerful

effects, both positive and negative, on

the environment, the economy and

the society of both generating and

receiving countries, on local communi-

ties and indigenous peoples, as well as

on international relations and trade,
Aiming
to promote responsible, sus-
tainable and universally accessible

tourism in the framework of the
right of all persons to use their free
time for leisure pursuits or travel

with respect for the choices of soci-

ety of all peoples,
But convinced
that the world
tourism industry as a whole has

much to gain by operating in an

environment that favours the mar-

ket economy, private enterprise

and free trade and that serves to

optimize its beneficial effects on

the creation of wealth and employ-

ment,
Also firmly convinced
that, provided
a number of principles and a cer-

tain number of rules are observed,

responsible and sustainable tourism

is by no means incompatible with

the growing liberalization of the

conditions governing trade in ser 
-
vices and under whose aegis the

enterprises of this sector operate

and that it is possible to reconcile

in this sector economy and ecology,

environment and development,

openness to international trade

and protection of social and cultural

identities, 
Considering
that, with such an
approach, all the stakeholders in

tourism development Œ national,

regional and local administrations,

enterprises, business associations,

workers in the sector, non-govern-

mental organizations and bodies

of all kinds belonging to the

tourism industry, as well as host

communities, the media and the

tourists themselves, have different

albeit interdependent responsibili-

ties in the individual and societal

development of tourism and that

the formulation of their individual

rights and duties will contribute to

meeting this aim,
Committed
, in keeping with the
aims pursued by the World

Tourism Organization itself since

adopting resolution 364(XII) at its

General Assembly of 1997

(Istanbul), to promote a genuine

partnership bet 
ween the public
and private stakeholders in

tourism development, and wishing

to see a partnership and coopera-

tion of the same kind extend, in

an open and balanced way, to the

relations between generating and
receiving countries and their
respective tourism industries,
Following up on
the Manila
Declarations of 1980 on World

Tourism and of 1997 on the Social

Impact of Tourism, as well as on the

Tourism Bill of Rights and the

Tourist Code adopted at Sofia in

1985 under the aegis of WTO, 
But believing
that these instru-
ments should be complemented by

a set of interdependent principles

for their interpretation and appli-

cation on which the stakeholders in

tourism development should

model their conduct at the dawn of

the twenty-first century,
Using
, for the purposes of this
instrument, the definitions and

classifications applicable to travel,

and especially the concepts of ﬁvis-

itorﬂ, ﬁtouristﬂ and ﬁtourismﬂ, as

adopted by the Ottawa Inter 
-
national Conference, held from 24

to 28 June 1991 and approved, in

1993, by the United Nations

Statistical Commission at its twenty-

seventh session,
Referring
in particular to the fol-
lowing instruments:
affirm the right to tourism and the
freedom of tourist movements, 
state our wish to promote an equi-
table, responsible and sustainable

world tourism order, whose benefits

will be shared by all sectors of soci-

ety in the context of an open and

liberalized international economy,

Tourism™s contribution to mutual
understanding and respect bet 
-
ween peoples and societies
1. The understanding and promo-
tion of the ethical values common

to humanity, with an attitude of

tolerance and respect for the diver-

sity of religious, philosophical and

moral beliefs, are both the founda-

tion and the consequence of

responsible tourism; stakeholders

in tourism development and

tourists themselves should observe

the social and cultural traditions

and practices of all peoples, includ-

ing those of minorities and indige-

nous peoples and to recognize

their worth;
2. Tourism activities should be con-
ducted in harmony with the attri 
-
butes and traditions of the host

regions and countries and in

respect for their laws, practices and

customs;
3. The host communities, on the
one hand, and local professionals,

on the other, should acquaint

themselves with and respect the

tourists who visit them and find

out about their lifestyles, tastes

and expectations; the education

and training imparted to profes-

sionals contribute to a hospitable

welcome;
4. It is the task of the public author-
ities to provide protection for

tourists and visitors and their

belongings; they must pay particu-

lar attention to the safety of for-

eign tourists owing to the particu-

lar vulnerability they may have;

they should facilitate the introduc-

tion of specific means of informa-

tion, prevention, security, insur-

ance and assistance consistent with

their needs; any attacks, assaults,

kidnappings or threats against

tourists or workers in the tourism

industry, as well as the wilful

destruction of tourism facilities or

of elements of cultural or natural
heritage should be severely con-
demned and punished in accor-

dance with their respective natio 
-
nal laws;
5. When travelling, tourists and vis-
itors should not commit any crimi-

nal act or any act considered crimi-

nal by the laws of the country visit-

ed and abstain from any conduct

felt to be offensive or injurious by

the local populations, or likely to

damage the local environment;

they should refrain from all traf-

ficking in illicit drugs, arms,

antiques, protected species and

products and substances that are

dangerous or prohibited by na 
tio 
nal
regulations;
6. Tourists and visitors have the
responsibility to acquaint them-

selves, even before their departure,

with the characteristics of the

countries they are preparing to

visit; they must be aware of the

health and security risks inherent in

any travel outside their usual envi-

ronment and behave in such a way

as to minimize those risks;
Tourism as a vehicle for individual
and collective fulfilment
1. Tourism, the activity most fre-
quently associated with rest and

relaxation, sport and access to cul-

ture and nature, should be planned

and practised as a privileged means

of individual and collective fulfil-

ment; when practised with a suffi-

ciently open mind, it is an irre-

placeable factor of self-education,

mutual tolerance and for learning

about the legitimate differences

between peoples and cultures and

their diversity;
2. Tourism activities should respect
the equality of men and women;

they should promote human rights

and, more particularly, the individual
rights of the most vulnerable
groups, notably children, the elderly,

the handicapped, ethnic minorities

and indigenous peoples;
3. The exploitation of human beings
in any form, particularly sexual,

especially when applied to chil-

dren, conflicts with the fundamen-

tal aims of tourism and is the nega-

tion of tourism; as such, in accor-

dance with international law, it

should be energetically combatted

with the cooperation of all the

States concerned and penalized

without concession by the national

legislation of both the countries

visited and the countries of the

perpetrators of these acts, even

when they are carried out abroad;
4. Travel for purposes of religion,
health, education and cultural or

linguistic exchanges are particularly

beneficial forms of tourism, which

deserve encouragement;
5. The introduction into curricula of
education about the value of

tourist exchanges, their economic,

social and cultural benefits, and also

their risks, should be encouraged;
Tourism, a factor of sustainable
de 
velopment
1. All the stakeholders in tourism
development should safeguard the

natural environment with a view to

achieving sound, continuous and sus-

tainable economic growth geared to

satisfying equitably the needs and

aspirations of present and future

generations;
2. All forms of tourism development
that are conducive to saving rare and

precious resources, in particular

water and energy, as well as avoiding

so far as possible waste production,

should be given priority and encour-

aged by national, regional and local

public authorities;
Article 
3. The staggering in time and space

of tourist and visitor flows, particu-

larly those resulting from paid

leave and school holidays, and a

more even distribution of holidays

should be sought so as to reduce

the pressure of tourism activity on

the environment and enhance its

beneficial impact on the tourism

industry and the local economy;
4. Tourism infrastructure should be
designed and tourism activities

programmed in such a way as to

protect the natural heritage com-

posed of ecosystems and biodiver-

sity and to preserve endangered

species of wildlife; the stakeholders

in tourism development, and espe-

cially professionals, should agree to

the imposition of limitations or

constraints on their activities when

these are exercised in particularly

sensitive areas: desert, polar or

high mountain regions, coastal

areas, tropical forests or wetlands,

propitious to the creation of

nature reserves or protected areas;
5. Nature tourism and ecotourism
are recognized as being particular-

ly conducive to enriching and

enhancing the standing of tourism,

provided they respect the natural

heritage and local populations and

are in keeping with the carrying

capacity of the sites;
Tourism, a user of the cultural her-
itage of mankind and a contributor

to its enhancement
1. Tourism resources belong to the
common heritage of mankind; the

communities in whose territories

they are situated have particular

rights and obligations to them;
2. Tourism policies and activities
should be conducted with respect

for the artistic, archaeological and

cultural heritage, which they
should protect and pass on to
future generations; particular care

should be devoted to preserving

and upgrading monuments, shrines

and museums as well as archaeo-

logical and historic sites which must

be widely open to tourist visits;

encouragement should be given to

public access to privately-owned

cultural property and monuments,

with respect for the rights of their

owners, as well as to religious

buildings, without prejudice to

normal needs of worship;
3. Financial resources derived from
visits to cultural sites and monu-

ments should, at least in part, be

used for the upkeep, safeguard,

development and embellishment

of this heritage;
4. Tourism activity should be
planned in such a way as to allow

traditional cultural products, crafts

and folklore to survive and flourish,

rather than causing them to degen-

erate and become standardized;
Tourism, a beneficial activity for
host countries and communi 
 

ties
1. Local populations should be asso-
ciated with tourism activities and

share equitably in the economic,

social and cultural benefits they

generate, and particularly in the

creation of direct and indirect jobs

resulting from them;
2. Tourism policies should be
applied in such a way as to help to

raise the standard of living of the

populations of the regions visited

and meet their needs; the planning

and architectural approach to and

operation of tourism resorts and

accommodation should aim to inte-

grate them, to the extent possible,

Tourism™s contribution to mutual
understanding and respect bet 
-
ween peoples and societies
1. The understanding and promo-
tion of the ethical values common

to humanity, with an attitude of

tolerance and respect for the diver-

sity of religious, philosophical and

moral beliefs, are both the founda-

tion and the consequence of

responsible tourism; stakeholders

in tourism development and

tourists themselves should observe

the social and cultural traditions

and practices of all peoples, includ-

ing those of minorities and indige-

nous peoples and to recognize

their worth;
2. Tourism activities should be con-
ducted in harmony with the attri 
-
butes and traditions of the host

regions and countries and in

respect for their laws, practices and

customs;
3. The host communities, on the
one hand, and local professionals,

on the other, should acquaint

themselves with and respect the

tourists who visit them and find

out about their lifestyles, tastes

and expectations; the education

and training imparted to profes-

sionals contribute to a hospitable

welcome;
4. It is the task of the public author-
ities to provide protection for

tourists and visitors and their

belongings; they must pay particu-

lar attention to the safety of for-

eign tourists owing to the particu-

lar vulnerability they may have;

they should facilitate the introduc-

tion of specific means of informa-

tion, prevention, security, insur-

ance and assistance consistent with

their needs; any attacks, assaults,

kidnappings or threats against

tourists or workers in the tourism

industry, as well as the wilful

destruction of tourism facilities or

of elements of cultural or natural
heritage should be severely con-
demned and punished in accor-

dance with their respective natio 
-
nal laws;
5. When travelling, tourists and vis-
itors should not commit any crimi-

nal act or any act considered crimi-

nal by the laws of the country visit-

ed and abstain from any conduct

felt to be offensive or injurious by

the local populations, or likely to

damage the local environment;

they should refrain from all traf-

ficking in illicit drugs, arms,

antiques, protected species and

products and substances that are

dangerous or prohibited by na 
tio 
nal
regulations;
6. Tourists and visitors have the
responsibility to acquaint them-

selves, even before their departure,

with the characteristics of the

countries they are preparing to

visit; they must be aware of the

health and security risks inherent in

any travel outside their usual envi-

ronment and behave in such a way

as to minimize those risks;
Tourism as a vehicle for individual
and collective fulfilment
1. Tourism, the activity most fre-
quently associated with rest and

relaxation, sport and access to cul-

ture and nature, should be planned

and practised as a privileged means

of individual and collective fulfil-

ment; when practised with a suffi-

ciently open mind, it is an irre-

placeable factor of self-education,

mutual tolerance and for learning

about the legitimate differences

between peoples and cultures and

their diversity;
2. Tourism activities should respect
the equality of men and women;

they should promote human rights

and, more particularly, the individual
rights of the most vulnerable
groups, notably children, the elderly,

the handicapped, ethnic minorities

and indigenous peoples;
3. The exploitation of human beings
in any form, particularly sexual,

especially when applied to chil-

dren, conflicts with the fundamen-

tal aims of tourism and is the nega-

tion of tourism; as such, in accor-

dance with international law, it

should be energetically combatted

with the cooperation of all the

States concerned and penalized

without concession by the national

legislation of both the countries

visited and the countries of the

perpetrators of these acts, even

when they are carried out abroad;
4. Travel for purposes of religion,
health, education and cultural or

linguistic exchanges are particularly

beneficial forms of tourism, which

deserve encouragement;
5. The introduction into curricula of
education about the value of

tourist exchanges, their economic,

social and cultural benefits, and also

their risks, should be encouraged;
Tourism, a factor of sustainable
de 
velopment
1. All the stakeholders in tourism
development should safeguard the

natural environment with a view to

achieving sound, continuous and sus-

tainable economic growth geared to

satisfying equitably the needs and

aspirations of present and future

generations;
2. All forms of tourism development
that are conducive to saving rare and

precious resources, in particular

water and energy, as well as avoiding

so far as possible waste production,

should be given priority and encour-

aged by national, regional and local

public authorities;
Article 
3. The staggering in time and space

of tourist and visitor flows, particu-

larly those resulting from paid

leave and school holidays, and a

more even distribution of holidays

should be sought so as to reduce

the pressure of tourism activity on

the environment and enhance its

beneficial impact on the tourism

industry and the local economy;
4. Tourism infrastructure should be
designed and tourism activities

programmed in such a way as to

protect the natural heritage com-

posed of ecosystems and biodiver-

sity and to preserve endangered

species of wildlife; the stakeholders

in tourism development, and espe-

cially professionals, should agree to

the imposition of limitations or

constraints on their activities when

these are exercised in particularly

sensitive areas: desert, polar or

high mountain regions, coastal

areas, tropical forests or wetlands,

propitious to the creation of

nature reserves or protected areas;
5. Nature tourism and ecotourism
are recognized as being particular-

ly conducive to enriching and

enhancing the standing of tourism,

provided they respect the natural

heritage and local populations and

are in keeping with the carrying

capacity of the sites;
Tourism, a user of the cultural her-
itage of mankind and a contributor

to its enhancement
1. Tourism resources belong to the
common heritage of mankind; the

communities in whose territories

they are situated have particular

rights and obligations to them;
2. Tourism policies and activities
should be conducted with respect

for the artistic, archaeological and

cultural heritage, which they
should protect and pass on to
future generations; particular care

should be devoted to preserving

and upgrading monuments, shrines

and museums as well as archaeo-

logical and historic sites which must

be widely open to tourist visits;

encouragement should be given to

public access to privately-owned

cultural property and monuments,

with respect for the rights of their

owners, as well as to religious

buildings, without prejudice to

normal needs of worship;
3. Financial resources derived from
visits to cultural sites and monu-

ments should, at least in part, be

used for the upkeep, safeguard,

development and embellishment

of this heritage;
4. Tourism activity should be
planned in such a way as to allow

traditional cultural products, crafts

and folklore to survive and flourish,

rather than causing them to degen-

erate and become standardized;
Tourism, a beneficial activity for
host countries and communi 
 

ties
1. Local populations should be asso-
ciated with tourism activities and

share equitably in the economic,

social and cultural benefits they

generate, and particularly in the

creation of direct and indirect jobs

resulting from them;
2. Tourism policies should be
applied in such a way as to help to

raise the standard of living of the

populations of the regions visited

and meet their needs; the planning

and architectural approach to and

operation of tourism resorts and

accommodation should aim to inte-

grate them, to the extent possible,

in the local economic and social fab-

ric; where skills are equal, priority

should be given to local manpower;
3. Special attention should be paid
to the specific problems of coastal

areas and island territories and to

vulnerable rural or mountain

regions, for which tourism often

represents a rare opportunity for

development in the face of the

decline of traditional economic

activities;
4. Tourism professionals, particularly
investors, governed by the regula-

suitable systems of insurance and

assistance;  they should accept the

reporting obligations prescribed

by national regulations and pay

fair compensation in the event of

failure to observe their contractu-

al obligations;
3. Tourism professionals, so far as
this depends on them, should con-

tribute to the cultural and spiritu-

al fulfilment of tourists and allow

them, during their travels, to

practise their religions;
4. The public authorities of the
generating States and the host

countries, in cooperation with the

professionals concerned and their

associations, should ensure that

the necessary mechanisms are in

place for the repatriation of

tourists in the event of the bank-

ruptcy of the enterprise that

organized their travel;
5. Governments have the right Œ
and the duty - especially in a crisis,

to inform their nationals of the

difficult circumstances, or even

the dangers they may encounter

during their travels abroad; it is

their responsibility however to

issue such information without

prejudicing in an unjustified or

exaggerated manner the tourism

industry of the host countries and

the interests of their own opera-

tors; the contents of travel advi-

sories should therefore be dis-

cussed beforehand with the

authorities of the host countries

and the professionals concerned;

recommendations formulated

should be strictly proportionate

to the gravity of the situations

encountered and confined to the

geographical areas where the

insecurity has arisen; such advi-

sories should be qualified or can-

celled as soon as a return to nor-

mality permits;
6. The press, and particularly the
specialized travel press and the

other media, including modern

means of electronic communica-
tion, should issue honest and bal-
anced information on events and

situations that could influence the

flow of tourists; they should also

provide accurate and reliable

information to the consumers of

tourism services; the new commu-

nication and electronic commerce

technologies should also be de 
-
veloped and used for this pur-

pose; as is the case for the media,

they should not in any way pro-

mote sex tourism;
Right to tourism
1. The prospect of direct and per-
sonal access to the discovery and

enjoyment of the planet™s resour 
-
ces constitutes a right equally

open to all the world™s inhabi-

tants; the increasingly extensive

participation in national and

international tourism should be

regarded as one of the best possi-

ble expressions of the sustained

growth of free time, and obsta-

cles should not be placed in its

way;
2. The universal right to tourism
must be regarded as the corollary

of the right to rest and leisure,

including reasonable limitation of

working hours and periodic holi-

days with pay, guaranteed by

Article 24 of the Universal

Declaration of Human Rights and

Article 7.d of the International

Covenant on Economic, Social and

Cultural Rights;
3. Social tourism, and in particular
associative tourism, which facili-

tates widespread access to leisure,

travel and holidays, should be

developed with the support of the

public authorities;
4. Family, youth, student and sen-
ior tourism and tourism for peo-

ple with disabilities, should be

encouraged and facilitated;
Liberty of tourist movements
1. Tourists and visitors should ben-
efit, in compliance with interna-

tio 
nal law and national legisla-
tion, from the liberty to move

within their countries and from

one State to another, in accor-

dance with Article 13 of the

Universal Declaration of Human

Rights; they should have access to

places of transit and stay and to

tourism and cultural sites without

being subject to excessive formal-

ities or discrimination;
2. Tourists and visitors should
have access to all available forms

of communication, internal or

external; they should benefit from

prompt and easy access to local

administrative, legal and health

services; they should be free to

contact the consular representa-

tives of their countries of origin in

compliance with the diplomatic

conventions in force;
3. Tourists and visitors should ben-
efit from the same rights as the

citizens of the country visited con-

cerning the confidentiality of the

personal data and information

concerning them, especially when

these are stored electronically;
4. Administrative procedures
relating to border crossings

whether they fall within the com-

petence of States or result from

international agreements, such as

visas or health and customs for-

malities, should be adapted, so far

as possible, so as to facilitate to

the maximum freedom of travel
and widespread access to interna-
tional tourism; agreements

between groups of countries to

harmonize and simplify these pro-

cedures should be encouraged;

specific taxes and levies penaliz-

ing the tourism industry and

undermining its competitiveness

should be gradually phased out or

corrected;
5. So far as the economic situation
of the countries from which they

come permits, travellers should

have access to allowances of con-

vertible currencies needed for

their travels;
Rights of the workers and entre-
preneurs in the tourism industry
1. The fundamental rights of
salaried and self-employed work-

ers in the tourism industry and

related activities, should be guar-

anteed under the supervision of

the national and local administra-

tions, both of their States of ori-

gin and of the host countries with

particular care, given the specific

constraints linked in particular to

the seasonality of their activity,

the global dimension of their

industry and the flexibility often

required of them by the nature of

their work;
2. Salaried and self-employed
wor 
kers in the tourism industry
and related activities have the

right and the duty to acquire

appropriate initial and continuous

training; they should be given

adequate social protection; job

insecurity should be limited so far

as possible; and a specific status,

with particular regard to their

social welfare, should be offered
to seasonal workers in the sector;
3. Any natural or legal person,
provided he, she or it has the nec-

essary abilities and skills, should

be entitled to develop a profes-

sional activity in the field of

- especially in the area of small

and medium-sized enterprises -

should be entitled to free access

to the tourism sector with a mini-

mum of legal or administrative

restrictions;
4. Exchanges of experience of 
-
fered to executives and workers,

whether salaried or not, from dif-

ferent countries, contributes to

foster the development of the

world tourism industry; these

movements should be facilitated

so far as possible in compliance

with the applicable national laws

and international conventions;
5. As an irreplaceable factor of
solidarity in the development and

dynamic growth of international

exchanges, multinational enter-

prises of the tourism industry

should not exploit the dominant

positions they sometimes occupy;

they should avoid becoming the

vehicles of cultural and social

models artificially imposed on the

host communities; in exchange for

their freedom to invest and trade

which should be fully recognized,

they should involve themselves in

local development, avoiding, by

the excessive repatriation of their

profits or their induced imports, a

reduction of their contribution to

the economies in which they are

established;
6. Partnership and the establish-
ment of balanced relations

between enterprises of genera

-
ing and receiving countries con-

tribute to the sustainable devel-

lopment of tourism and an equi-

of its growth;

development should recognize

the role of international institu-

tions, among which the World

rights, the environment or health,
