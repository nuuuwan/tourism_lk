Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report May 2025
Top ten source markets
May 2025
"An analysis of key source markets reveals that  India stands as the undisputed leader,"
contributing a dominant 35.4% of total arrivals. This signifies an exceptionally strong and
"consistent inbound flow, likely driven by geographical proximity, cultural ties, and robust"
"air  connectivity.  While  this  provides  a  strong  foundation  for  Sri  Lanka's  tourism,  such"
heavy reliance on a single market also presents a vulnerability; any significant negative
shifts in Indian outbound travel could disproportionately impact overall arrivals.
"Following  India,  the  market  share  distribution  becomes  more  fragmented.  The  United"
"Kingdom  (6.9%)  and  China  (6.6%)  are  the  next  significant  contributors,  collectively"
accounting for around 13.5% of arrivals.
"Bangladesh  (5.5%),  Germany  (5.4%),  and  Australia  (4.5%)  form  a  mid-tier  group  of"
"contributors. The consistent presence of Germany indicates a mature European market,"
often associated with higher-spending tourists and specialized interests (as seen in the
"""Health/Ayurvedic""  purpose).  Bangladesh's  strong  showing  points  to  robust  regional"
"connections  and  perhaps  a  growing  outbound  travel  market.  Australia,  as  a  long-haul"
"market,  signifies  successful  efforts  in  attracting  visitors  especially  for  VFR  purposes"
despite the greater distance.
"Further  down  the  list,  France  (4.1%),  the  United  States  (2.7%),  Canada  (2.6%),  and"
"Russia  (2.5%) represent  smaller, but  still  important,  segments.  The  European markets"
"(France,  Germany) highlight  continued  interest  from  traditional  Western  sources,  while"
"the Americas (US, Canada) represent markets with significant untapped potential, often"
"associated with higher average spending. Russia's presence, while smaller, indicates the"
success of specific initiatives or direct flight connections from this market.
"Understanding the unique characteristics and travel behaviors of each of these markets,"
"is paramount for developing effective, tailored tourism strategies."
