July 2025
An  analysis  of  airline  preferences  by  source  market  reveals  that  Sri  Lankan  Airlines
"maintains  strong  market  leadership  in  traditional  Commonwealth  and  regional  markets,"
"securing dominant positions in Australia (54.49%), Canada (41.82%), and India (36.23%)."
"Gulf  carriers  have  achieved  collective  dominance  across  European  markets,  controlling"
"approximately  70%  of  passenger  traffic  from  the  UK,  Netherlands,  and  Germany.  Qatar"
Airways  demonstrates  particular  strength in the  Spanish  market  with  28.64%  share.
"However, the UK market presents a unique competitive landscape where market share is"
"relatively  balanced  among  three  major  carriers:  Sri  Lankan  Airlines  (26.49%),  Emirates"
"(21.99%), and Qatar Airways (22.26%)."
"Chinese travelers  show  strong  preference for  domestic  carriers,  with  China  Eastern"
"commanding 33.15% and Air China holding 10.08% of the market. In addition, Sri Lankan"
Airlines (15.93%) and Cathay Pacific (15.11%) are the other key airlines used by Chinese
"tourists.  Meanwhile,  Australian  passengers  predominantly  choose  Sri  Lankan  Airlines"
(54.49%) alongside Singapore Airlines (23.25%) as their preferred carriers.
"The United States market exhibits significant fragmentation, with no single carrier achieving"
"clear dominance. Qatar Airways leads with 20.51%, closely followed by Sri Lankan Airlines"
"at 20.20%, while Emirates captures 8.66% and IndiGo secures 10.90%, creating a highly"
competitive environment across multiple carriers.
These patterns reveal distinct regional preferences and strategic dependencies. European
travelers  demonstrate  overwhelming  reliance  on  Gulf  hub  connectivity  for  reaching  Sri
"Lanka,  while  other markets  favour either direct  services  (such as Sri  Lankan's routes  to"
Australia  and  Canada)  or  regional  low-cost  carriers  (like  IndiGo's  strong  Indian  market
presence).
"Sri  Lanka's tourism  connectivity relies  heavily  on regional transit  hubs,  with  clear"
"geographic  patterns  emerging.  For  European travelers (UK,  Netherlands,  Germany,"
"France,  Spain),  Gulf  airports  dominate  as  transit  points:  Dubai,  Doha,  and  Abu  Dhabi"
"collectively account for 52-66%, underscoring their role as critical gateways for long haul"
"traffic. Conversely, Indian tourists arrive primarily via direct flights from domestic airports,"
"with Chennai (33%), Bangalore (15%), Delhi (12%), Mumbai (13%), and Hyderabad (10%)"
together representing 83% of departures demonstrating minimal reliance on intermediate
"hubs.  Australians  depend  significantly  on  Southeast  Asian  connections,  with  Singapore"
"(33%)  and  Melbourne  (27%)  as  primary  departure  points,  while  Chinese  tourists  depart"
overwhelmingly  from  Shanghai  (23%)  and  Hong  Kong  (15%).  The  U.S.  market  shows
"fragmented routing, using Singapore (12%), Hong Kong (4%), and Gulf hubs (Dubai 9%,"
"Doha 21%, Abu Dhabi 12%). Secondary hubs like Istanbul serve niche roles for French"
"(12%) and Dutch (6.2%) travelers, and London functions primarily for UK originating tourists"
(20% direct).
This hub centric  model reveals strategic dependencies:  Gulf airports anchor
"European/North  American  connectivity,  Southeast  Asian  hubs (Singapore,  Bangkok)"
"facilitate  Asia  Pacific traffic,  and  direct flights  dominate  short  haul  markets (India)."
Opportunities exist to diversify routes particularly direct European connections.
