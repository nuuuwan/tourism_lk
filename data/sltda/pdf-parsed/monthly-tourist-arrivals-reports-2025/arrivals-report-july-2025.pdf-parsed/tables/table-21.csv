Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report July 2025
"Main last departure airports and airlines to Sri Lanka,"
July 2025
Analysis  of  departure  airports  for  tourists  to  Sri  Lanka  in  July  reveals  the  strategic
importance  of  major  international  aviation  hubs  in  facilitating  connectivity  to  the  island
"nation. Middle Eastern airports emerge as the primary gateways, with Dubai leading at"
"14.50%, followed by Doha at 12.70% and Abu Dhabi at 8.78%. Combined, these three"
"hubs handle more than one third of all tourist departures, demonstrating the pivotal role"
"of Gulf carriers, Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad in linking Sri Lanka to global markets"
"across Europe, North America, and Africa."
"Indian airports represent the second largest departure cluster, collectively managing over"
"22% of outbound traffic. Chennai tops the Indian gateways at 7.53%, with Delhi (4.67%),"
"Mumbai  (4.40%),  Bangalore  (3.38%),  and  Hyderabad  (2.04%)  following  as  significant"
departure points. This pattern confirms India's dual role as both a primary tourist source
and a crucial transit corridor for travelers from other countries accessing Sri Lanka.
"Asian  regional  hubs  demonstrate  moderate  but  meaningful  connectivity  levels,  with"
Singapore accounting for 3.85% and Kuala Lumpur for 3.61% of departures. Additional
"Asian gateways including Bangkok (1.87%), Shanghai (1.73%), and Hong Kong (1.64%)"
illustrate  Sri  Lanka's  growing  integration  with  broader  Asian  travel  networks  and  the
region's increasing significance in tourism flows.
"European  connectivity  appears  more limited,  with  London representing  2.97%  of"
"departures,  while  Frankfurt  (1.22%)  and  Paris  (1.07%)  show  smaller  shares.  These"
relatively modest figures suggest that European tourists continue to rely heavily on Middle
Eastern  transit  hubs  rather  than  direct  European  connections.  Additional  noteworthy
"departure  points  include  Istanbul  (3.38%)  and  Sharjah  (3.88%),  further  reinforcing  the"
dominance  of  Middle  Eastern  aviation infrastructure.  Long  haul  destinations like
Melbourne (1.40%) and Narita (0.77%) likely reflect diaspora connections and specialized
tourism segments from Australia and Japan.
These findings suggest Sri Lanka should prioritize strengthening partnerships with Middle
Eastern  and Indian  airlines  while  simultaneously  pursuing  expanded  direct flight
connectivity to reduce transit dependency. Developing regional tourism circuits through
"Southeast  Asian  hubs  like  Singapore  and  Kuala  Lumpur,  combined  with  continued"
"investment  in  aviation  infrastructure  and  route  expansion,  could  significantly  improve"
tourist accessibility and drive sector growth. Sri Lankan Airlines emerges as the dominant
"force  in  July's  tourist  arrivals,  commanding  over  a  quarter  (25.43%)  of  all  traffic  with"
"50,916 passengers. This underscores its critical role as the national carrier in facilitating"
"tourism. Gulf based airlines collectively form the second largest bloc, contributing 40.6%"
"of arrivals through Emirates (12.32%), Qatar Airways (12.21%), Etihad Airways (7.84%),"
"Fly  Dubai  (4.41%),  and  Air  Arabia  (3.82%).  Their  strong  performance  highlights  Sri"
Lanka's heavy reliance on Middle Eastern transit hubs for tourist connectivity.
"Regional  airlines  also  play  significant  roles,  particularly  in  key  source  markets.  Indian"
"carriers IndiGo  (9.97%) and  Air  India  (4.80%) together account  for 14.77%  of  arrivals,"
reflecting  robust  tourist  flows  from  India.  East  Asian  connectivity  is  served  by  China
"Eastern Airlines (2.53%), Singapore Airlines (2.17%), and Air China (0.68%), though their"
collective share (5.38%) suggests room for growth in these markets. European and long
"haul  traffic  is  facilitated  by  Turkish  Airlines  (3.38%)  and  Cathay  Pacific  (1.64%),  while"
niche players like Fits Air (1.19%) and AirAsia (1.73%) cater to specialized segments.
