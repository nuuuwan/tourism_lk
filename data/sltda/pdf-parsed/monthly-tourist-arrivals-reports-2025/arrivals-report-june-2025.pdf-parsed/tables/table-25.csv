Top ten markets versus main last departure
airports and Main airlines to Sri Lanka
June 2025
A detailed breakdown of tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka from the top ten source markets by
"last port of departure, offers a layered understanding of travel patterns, transit hubs, and"
regional connectivity.
"Unsurprisingly, India  dominates the  chart  with  a total  of  37,934  arrivals,  heavily"
"concentrated  through  Chennai  (10,386),  Delhi  (5,649),  Mumbai  (5,699),  and  Bangalore"
"(5,158), demonstrating a strong reliance on direct regional gateways and short-haul travel."
"This indicates that Indian tourists tend to travel directly via major Indian cities, supported"
"by proximity, frequency of flights, and possibly VFR and business ties."
"The  United  Kingdom  (11,628) shows a  significant  concentration  via  London  (3,643) and"
"Middle Eastern hubs like Abu Dhabi (1,739) and Dubai (1,563), which are commonly used"
transit  points for  long-haul  European travelers.  This  suggests that  connecting flights
through the Gulf play a critical role in facilitating arrivals from Western countries.
"China (8,804) shows an interesting pattern with a relatively low volume through Indian or"
"Gulf  ports,  but  very  high  numbers  via  Shanghai (2,358)  and  Hong  Kong (1,361),"
"emphasizing  the  significance  of  direct  East  Asian  hubs,  though  some  dispersal  through"
Kuala Lumpur and Singapore is evident.
"Australia  (7,299)  mainly  routes through  Singapore  (2,502)  and  Kuala  Lumpur  (771),"
"indicating strong reliance on Southeast Asian aviation hubs for connectivity to Sri Lanka,"
consistent with standard airline routing in the Asia Pacific region.
"Notably, Pakistan (6,833) shows a very high dependence on Dubai (2,911) and Abu Dhabi"
"(1,045),  reaffirming  the  role  of  UAE  as  a  bridge  between  South  Asia  and  Sri  Lanka."
"Likewise, Bangladesh (5,826) has strong routing through Dhaka (2,115) and Male (1,648),"
revealing a more regionally networked route via South Asia.
"For  Germany  (5,498),  arrivals  are  mainly  split  between  Abu  Dhabi  (1,397)  and  Dubai"
"(1,371), confirming again the Middle East as a vital corridor for European markets."
"In the case of the United States (5,422), multiple entry points are utilized, but there is a"
"notable number through Doha (1,077), Dubai (728) which aligns with typical transit routes"
via the Gulf.
"France (4,345) and Canada (4,293) also show strong reliance on Gulf hubs such as Dubai,"
"Abu Dhabi, and Doha, while Canada also sees notable movement via Abu Dhabi (965) and"
Dubai (730).
"This  data  highlights  the  central  role  of  Middle  Eastern  hubs  like  Dubai,  Abu  Dhabi,  and"
"Doha  as  critical transit  points for  Western  and  South  Asian tourists,  while  regional"
connectivity through Indian cities dominates travel from neighboring South Asian countries.
"East and Southeast Asian hubs like Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Shanghai, and Hong Kong"
are especially significant for travelers from China and Australia. These insights are crucial
"in planning route development, marketing strategies, and bilateral tourism partnerships."
