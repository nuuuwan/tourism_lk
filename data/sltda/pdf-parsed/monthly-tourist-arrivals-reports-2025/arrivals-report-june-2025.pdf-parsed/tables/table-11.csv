"India maintained its position as the leading source market, with 241,994 arrivals, showing"
"significant  growth from  184,468 in  2024  a  remarkable increase  of  over  31%.  This"
"performance underscores India’s strong regional connection, accessibility, and continued"
"travel interest in Sri Lanka. The Russian Federation, despite a slight decline from 114,104"
"to 112,312, retained its position as the second-largest contributor, suggesting continued"
outbound demand despite potential geopolitical or economic factors.
"The  United  Kingdom  showed  robust  growth,  rising  from  89,352  to  107,902  arrivals  an"
"increase of nearly 21%, reflecting the strength of Western European markets. Similarly,"
"Germany  also  grew  steadily,  reaching  74,576  arrivals  compared  to  70,070  last  year."
"China, though traditionally a strong market, saw a modest decline from 68,764 to 65,787,"
potentially indicating lingering travel  constraints  or  shifting  outbound  preferences.
"Meanwhile, France showed impressive growth at over 24%, with arrivals increasing from"
"49,340 to 61,457."
"Notably,  Australia  recorded  a  sharp  increase  from  40,746  to  51,325,  and  Bangladesh"
"more  than  doubled  its  arrivals  from  15,632  to  33,137,  indicating  successful  regional"
outreach  and  emerging  potential.  The  United  States  continued  to  perform  consistently
"with  a  small  but  steady  rise,  while  the  Netherlands  also  grew  from  19,466  to  26,139,"
reflecting increasing interest from smaller European markets.
"Overall, the data signals a strong and diversified recovery in Sri Lanka’s tourism sector"
"for the first half of 2025, with particularly promising growth from South Asia, Europe, and"
"the Asia-Pacific. However, small declines from markets like Russia and China suggest"
the importance of targeted re-engagement strategies to maintain momentum across all
regions.  This  balanced  performance  also  highlights the importance  of  sustained
"promotion, improved connectivity, and strategic market diversification to ensure long-term"
resilience and sustainable growth in the tourism industry.
