Top ten source markets
June 2025
An analysis of the top ten source markets for Sri Lanka in June  2025 reveals a strong
overall upward trend in tourist arrivals. India continues to dominate as the leading source
"market,  with  37,934  arrivals—up  from  28,631  in  June  2024—marking  a  robust  32.4%"
"increase.  This  growth  is  bolstered  by  both  air  and  sea  arrivals,  underscoring  India’s"
"geographic proximity, cultural links, and increasing travel interest. The United Kingdom"
"holds  the  second  position  with  11,628  visitors,  showing  a  25.6%  year-on-year  growth,"
"reflecting the steady recovery of long-haul travel from Western Europe. China, despite"
"being the third-largest market, showed a slight decline in arrivals from 9,222 to 8,804 (a"
"4.5% drop), possibly due to outbound travel restrictions or reduced destination visibility."
"Australia,  ranked  fourth,  posted  a  healthy  15.5%  increase,  rising  from  6,317  to  7,299"
"arrivals.  Notably,  Pakistan  showed  the most  dramatic  surge,  with  arrivals  skyrocketing"
"from 1,399 in 2024 to 6,833 in 2025—an increase of nearly 389%. This could be attributed"
to ongoing religious convention and conference in Sri Lanka and improved bilateral ties.
"Bangladesh  also  performed  well,  with  arrivals  rising  33.2%  to  reach  5,826.  European"
markets  such  as  Germany  and  France  showed  solid  growth  at  20.7%  and  40.1%
"respectively, indicating strong interest from Western Europe. Similarly, arrivals from the"
"United  States  increased  by  34.8%,  and  Canada  recorded  a  29.9%  rise,  signaling  a"
resurgence of North American travel interest in Sri Lanka.
"Across all markets, air travel remains the predominant mode of entry, with minimal sea"
"arrivals—except  from  India,  which  recorded  641  arrivals  by  sea,  pointing  to  emerging"
"maritime travel potential. Overall, this distribution highlights Sri Lanka’s growing appeal"
"across  both  regional  and  long-haul  markets.  However,  the  decline  from  China  and"
continued  dependence  on  a  few  key  regions  also  signals  the  need  for  diversification.
"Strategic focus on underrepresented but growing markets like Pakistan, Bangladesh, and"
North America could help build a more balanced and resilient tourism sector.
