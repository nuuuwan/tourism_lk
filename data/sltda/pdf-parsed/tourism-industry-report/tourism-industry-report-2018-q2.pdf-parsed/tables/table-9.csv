AIRPORT KIOSK SELF SURVEY 2018
"In  mid-February  2018,  SLTDA  installed  two  touch-screen  self-service  kiosks  at  the  pier  and  departure"
lounges at the Bandaranaike International Airport to obtain quick feedback of tourists departing Sri Lanka.
The main objective of this initiative is to support visitor profiling and assessing satisfaction rates to improve
"services and facilities for tourists. As at 30th June, the total number of respondents via the kiosk was 2,190."
"However, some questions may be missed. The highest number of respondents were by visitors from India,"
"UK, Germany, Australia and France and in the 20- 29 age group. The majority (72%) of respondents were"
"male (out of 1,637 respondents). Highlights  of responses  related to service  satisfaction are shared as a"
sample.
