"Year in review, January to June 2025"
"During this six month period in 2025, a total of 51 investment project proposals were received,"
"covering 1,564 rooms with a cumulative proposed investment value of USD 169.096 million."
"This indicates a moderate but steady inflow of new interest in tourism-related developments,"
particularly given the challenges of economic recovery and global uncertainty in recent years.
"Out  of  these,  22  projects  were  approved,  which  account  for  424  rooms  and  a  confirmed"
investment value of USD 53.566 million.
While the number of projects and investment volume is lower compared to peak years such
"as  2011  and  2018,  the  current  figures  suggest  a  gradual  recovery  and  growing  investor"
"confidence, particularly after the downturn seen in 2020 and the cautious pace observed in"
"2021–2022. If the trend from the first half continues, the full-year total for 2025 could exceed"
that of 2024 in both volume and value of received and approved projects.
The January to June 2025 data shows a cautiously optimistic investment climate in Sri Lanka’s
"tourism sector, with a respectable number of proposals received and a solid proportion moving"
"forward  to  approval.  This  performance,  halfway  through  the  year,  indicates  potential  for"
"stronger second half results, especially with supportive policies and investor facilitation."
