"Year in review, January to June 2025"
"Leisure oriented purposes also contribute significantly to longer stays, consistently exceeding"
"the  overall  average. Pleasure/Vacation  tourists  stayed  an average  of  8.87  days,  while  Sports"
related  visitors  averaged  9.01  days.  This  indicates  that  traditional  holidaymakers  and  those
"engaged in  sporting  activities (potentially including  participants,  spectators,  or  adventure"
"tourists)  contribute  meaningfully  to  sustained  tourism  revenue.  MICE  (Meetings,  Incentives,"
"Conferences, Exhibitions) tourism also recorded a healthy average of 7.97 days, suggesting that"
business events often incorporate leisure extensions or require multi day engagements.
"Mid  duration  purposes  cluster  around  the  grand  average,  including  segments  with  specific"
"logistical  or  structured itineraries.  Official travel  averaged  7.07  days,  aligning  with typical"
durations for government or institutional visits. Religious tourism recorded a moderate average
"of 6.93 days, indicative of pilgrimage circuits or spiritual retreats requiring a dedicated but not"
"excessively long timeframe, shorter than VFR but longer than purely transactional visits."
"Business and Education purposes represent the shortest stay segments, characterized by high"
"traveler turnover. Business travel had the briefest average duration at just 5.04 days, aligning"
"with  global trends for  efficiency-focused  commercial trips,  meetings,  and trade  activities."
"Education related visits averaged slightly longer at 5.36 days, still well below the grand average."
"This suggests the segment is dominated by short term workshops, academic conferences, or"
"training programs rather than semester long exchanges, impacting the type of accommodation"
and services required.
The  data  provides  crucial insights for tourism  planning.  The  exceptionally long  stays  of
Health/Ayurveda  tourists  solidify  it  as  a  high  value  niche  deserving  targeted  infrastructure
"investment (specialized resorts, clinics) and international promotion. VFR tourism's stability and"
duration offer opportunities for enhancing community-based experiences and repeat visitation
"incentives.  While  Business  and  Education  generate  shorter  stays, their  volume remains"
important  for  urban  hotels  and  ancillary  services;  optimizing  transit  efficiency  and  short-stay
"facilities  is  key  for  these  segments.  Leisure  purposes  (Pleasure,  Sports,  MICE)  reinforce  the"
"need for  diverse,  high-quality  experiences to  maintain their  healthy  durations.  Ultimately,"
"understanding  these  duration  patterns  by  purpose  is  vital  for  resource  allocation,  product"
"development, and tailored marketing strategies to maximize both visitor numbers and economic"
impact per arrival.
