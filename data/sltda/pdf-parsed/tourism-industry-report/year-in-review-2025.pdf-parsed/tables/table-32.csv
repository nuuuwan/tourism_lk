Distribution of rooms by provinces
(January to June - 2025)
A comparative analysis of the number of rooms in SLTDA registered establishments across
Sri Lanka’s provinces for the periods January to June 2024 and January to June 2025 shows
"a  notable  upward trend in room  capacity  across  most  provinces, indicating  continued"
investment and growth in the country’s accommodation sector.
"At the national level, the total number of rooms has increased from 53,378 in the first half of"
"2024 to 56,702 in the corresponding period of 2025. This reflects a net growth of 3,324 rooms,"
amounting  to  a  6.2%  increase.  The  expansion  signals  a  healthy  trajectory  for  the  tourism
"industry,  supported  by  growing  demand  and  a  conducive  environment  for  tourism  related"
investment.
"Among the provinces, the Western Province recorded the highest number of rooms, growing"
"from  18,716  in  2024  to  19,924  in  2025.  This  increase  of  1,208  rooms  underscores  the"
province’s  importance  as  the  commercial  and  tourism  hub  of  the  country.  The  Southern
"Province, known for its beaches and heritage sites, saw the second largest increase, adding"
"820 rooms to reach a total of 14,536. The Central Province, home to major cultural attractions"
"and natural beauty, also experienced significant growth, rising from 8,771 to 9,437 rooms a"
gain of 666.
"Other provinces showed more modest growth. The Eastern Province added 223 rooms, while"
"the North Central and North Western Provinces increased by 150 and 142 rooms, respectively."
Sabaragamuwa Province saw a smaller addition of 77 rooms. Uva Province recorded only a
"marginal increase of 35 rooms, and the Northern Province remained nearly static with a slight"
"increase of just 3 rooms, indicating minimal growth or continued stagnation in that region."
"The strongest growth was concentrated in the Western, Southern, and Central Provinces areas"
that are already well established in the tourism circuit. The distribution of SLTDA registered
"rooms  across  Sri  Lanka’s  provinces  shows  a  significant  concentration in the  Western,"
"Southern, and Central Provinces, which together account for nearly 78% of all available rooms."
"The Western Province leads with the highest number, followed by the Southern and Central"
"Provinces, reflecting the strong focus of tourism infrastructure and investment in these areas"
"due  to  their  established  attractions,  superior infrastructure, and  proximity  to major  transport"
"hubs.  In  contrast,  provinces  such  as  Northern,  Sabaragamuwa,  North  Central,  and  North"
"Western  have  much fewer  registered  rooms, indicating  underdevelopment  or  untapped"
tourism  potential  in  these  regions.  This  disparity  highlights  the  need  for  targeted  policy
"measures and investment to promote balanced tourism growth, diversify visitor experiences,"
and support broader regional economic development. These trends highlight the need for more
targeted  promotional  and  investment  strategies  in  underrepresented  regions  such  as  the
Northern and Uva Provinces to achieve a more balanced development of tourism infrastructure
across the country.
