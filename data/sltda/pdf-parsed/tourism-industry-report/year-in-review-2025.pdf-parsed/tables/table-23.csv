"Year in review, January to June 2025"
Tourists from the top source markets exhibited significant variation in their average length
of  stay  in Sri  Lanka during  the  first half  of  2025.  In  general January is the month  of  the
"longest duration for many key source markets except for tourists from India (May), United"
States (May) and Bangladesh (February).
"Markets averaging over 10 nights generally maintained this level, but with distinct patterns."
"France  (61,457  arrivals)  was  notably  stable  year  round,  with  average  stays  fluctuating"
"minimally  between  10.17  nights  (May)  and  11.77  nights  (January).  Australia  (51,325"
"arrivals) also showed relative consistency, staying between 9.99 nights (June) and 11.67"
"nights  (January),  with  a  slight  peak  in  April  (11.44  nights).  Russia's  duration  peaked  in"
January  (11.96  nights)  and  remained  high  until  a  noticeable  dip  in  June  (8.42  nights).
"Germany  exhibited the  most  volatility,  starting  very  high in  January  (14.96  nights),"
"remaining above 13 nights through April (13.12 nights), then dropping sharply in May (8.77"
nights) before partially recovering in June (12.57 nights). The Netherlands consistently had
"the  longest durations, starting  at  16.26 nights  in  January and  staying  above 13.5  nights"
every month.
"Within the mid-range (6-10 nights), the United Kingdom (107,902 arrivals) showed stability,"
averaging  between  9.16  nights  (May)  and  10.53  nights  (January).  The  United  States
"(34,413 arrivals) displayed a gradual but steady increase in stay length from 6.65 nights in"
"March to 8.23 nights in June. China (65,787 arrivals) had the shortest stays in this group,"
"consistently  ranging  between  5.67  nights  (May)  and  6.46  nights  (January),  making  it  a"
"bridge to the short-stay markets. India and Bangladesh, as the primary short stay markets,"
"maintained  consistently  low  durations  below  5.5  nights  throughout  the  period,  indicating"
"frequent, shorter regional visits."
The  data  reveals  clear  seasonal  influences  and  market  behaviors.  Long-stay  European
"markets (Germany, Netherlands, Russia, UK, France) generally peaked in duration during"
"the  Northern  Hemisphere  winter  months (January-February), suggesting travelers"
escaping colder climates for extended holidays. A notable shift occurred in early summer
"(June),  with  Russia  experiencing  its  shortest  average  stay  (8.42  nights)  and  the  US"
"reaching its longest (8.23 nights), hinting at differing summer travel patterns. Germany's"
significant  May dip  (8.77  nights) is an outlier  needing  further investigation.  Markets  also
"differed in consistency: India, Bangladesh, France, and the UK showed minimal monthly"
"fluctuation, indicating  predictable travel  behavior. In  contrast,  Germany  and  Russia"
"experienced  significant  volatility.  Importantly,  there  was  no  direct  correlation  between"
"market size (arrival numbers) and stay duration: high volume India had the shortest stays,"
while mid sized Netherlands had the longest.
