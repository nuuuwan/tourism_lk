"Year in review, January to June 2025"
"Visiting Friends and Relatives (VFR) exhibits strong regional patterns, particularly linked to"
"diaspora  connections. Australia emerged  as the  leader in  VFR  travel proportionally,  with"
"26.0%  (13,358  arrivals)  of  its  tourists  citing  this  purpose.  The  United  Kingdom  (17.6%,"
"19,011 arrivals) and the United States (17.5%, 6,023 arrivals) also showed significant VFR"
"segments. Business travel showed notable importance for India (4.7%, 11,341 arrivals the"
"highest  absolute  number)  and  China  (3.7%,  2,426  arrivals),  aligning  with  established"
"economic ties.  MICE  (Meetings, Incentives,  Conferences,  Exhibitions)  was  a  notable"
"segment for France (9.0%, 5,515 arrivals the highest share among major markets), India"
"(6.1%, 14,740 arrivals highest absolute number), and Russia (5.7%, 6,399 arrivals)."
Specialized niche purposes reveal distinct  market opportunities and interests.
"Health/Ayurveda tourism  was overwhelmingly  dominated by Germany,  which  contributed"
"3,594 arrivals (4.8% of German tourists) the highest among major markets, reinforcing its"
"status as a key long stay, high value segment. Religious Tourism was almost exclusively"
"driven  by  India  (0.8%,  1,979  arrivals)  and  the  United  States  (2.1%,  729  arrivals),  with"
"negligible numbers from other countries. Sports Tourism saw India (0.4%, 1,041 arrivals)"
"and the United Kingdom (0.6%, 650 arrivals) leading in absolute terms."
This  purpose  based  segmentation  offers  vital  insights  for  targeted  tourism  strategies.
"Leisure-Centric  Markets (France,  Germany,  UK,  Netherlands,  Australia,  US)  warrant"
"continued promotion of diverse experiences (cultural, beach, adventure). Diaspora Driven"
"Markets  (Australia,  UK,  US)  highlight  the  need  for  enhanced  VFR  focused  services  and"
connectivity. Specialized Niches present clear opportunities: Germany's strong Ayurveda
"demand justifies targeted health tourism infrastructure development and marketing, while"
India's  religious  tourism  potential  appears  underdeveloped  relative  to  its  sheer  volume.
"Finally, Business/MICE shows potential for growth, particularly leveraging strong economic"
links with India and China. Understanding these distinct market priorities enables Sri Lanka
to tailor  offerings  and  allocate  marketing  resources  strategically to  maximize  tourism
revenue and economic impact.
