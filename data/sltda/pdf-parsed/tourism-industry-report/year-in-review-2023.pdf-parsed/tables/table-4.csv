Year  in Review  -2023
"During the  first six  months, tourist  arrivals grew  by 6.7%  compared to  the same  months  in"
"the previous year, showcasing a positive trend in the industry. This growth indicates increased"
interest  in Sri Lanka  as a tourist destination.
"Notably,  June  experienced  the  highest  growth  rate,  with  a  remarkable  increase  of  205.5%"
"compared to the previous year. This could be attributed to various factors, such as favorable"
weather  conditions and holiday seasons in the main source markets.
"J                                               uly recorded the highest number of tourist arrivals, reaching 143,039 visitors. This suggests"
"that July is a peak tourist season, possibly due to summer vacations."
"In contrast, May had the lowest number of tourist arrivals, with 83,309 visitors. Factors like"
less  favorable  weather  or  fewer  incentives  for  travel  during  this  period  might  contribute  to
this lower figure.
