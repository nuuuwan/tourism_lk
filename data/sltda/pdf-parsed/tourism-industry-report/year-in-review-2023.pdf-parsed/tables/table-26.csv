Year  in Review  -2023
The total number of visitors recorded in Sri Lanka's
Wildlife  parks  operated  by the  Department  of
Wildlife Conservation  for  the  period  from  January
"to  June  was  664,179.  Among  these,  there  were"
"218,227 foreign visitors and 445,952 local visitors."
"In terms  of foreign  visitors,  Yala,  Udawalawa,"
"Mirissa (Whale watching), and Eth Athuru Sewana"
were the most popular destinations during the first
six  months  of  2023.  These  parks  experienced
"peak  visitation  during the  months  of  January,"
"February,  March,  and  April.  However, it's  worth"
noting  that  Yala  received  a  significant  number  of
"foreign visitors, while other parks like Wasgomuwa"
had  comparatively lower foreign  visitor  numbers
"(only 502 visitors), indicating the need for"
promoting  lesser-visited  parks  as  alternatives to
"alleviate the pressure on Yala, which faces issues"
related to carrying  capacity.
"For  domestic  tourists,  the  major  attractions  were"
"Yala,  Horton  Plains,  Udawalawa,  and  Eth  Athuru"
Sevana. The peak months for domestic tourists in
"these  destinations  were  April,  February, and"
March  due to favorable  weather  conditions  and
holidays.
