"Africa, and Hungary."
"Moderate  growth  was  recorded  from  Portugal,  Japan,  the  United  Kingdom,  Greece,  Italy,"
"France, Thailand, Spain, Belgium, Slovakia, and South Korea. In contrast, India, Denmark,"
"Indonesia,  Maldives,  Sweden,  Ukraine,  and  Pakistan  showed  slower  growth  rates.  Russia"
"and  Canada,  despite being  key markets,  saw the  slowest  recovery, likely due  to  changing"
preferences among Russian travelers and reduced visits from Canada for Visiting Friends and
