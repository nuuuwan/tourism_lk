International  tourist  arrivals  to  Sri  Lanka  recovered  31%  of  pre  pandemic  levels  (2018).
"Europe, the  largest  source of  tourists  to Sri  Lanka  enjoyed the  strongest  relative  increase"
across regions in 2022 with arrivals climbing to 42.5% of pre pandemic levels (-57.5 versus
"2018). Asia and Pacific recorded 213,537 arrivals in 2022 to reach nearly 20% of  arrivals"
recorded in 2018. Africa and Americas recovered about 31.5% and 38% respectively while
Middle East  reached 26% of 2018 arrivals.
The  recovery  of  tourism  can  be  attributed  to  the  pent-up  demand  and  the  lifting  of  travel
"restrictions. However, there are also challenges that could have impeded the progress, such"
as the  increasing geopolitical  tensions resulting  from  the Russian  invasion of  Ukraine  and
the challenging  economic conditions.
