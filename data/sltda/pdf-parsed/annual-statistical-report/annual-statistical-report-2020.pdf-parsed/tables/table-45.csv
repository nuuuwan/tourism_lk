Table  27  in  the  Statistical  Appendix  shows  the  volume  of  employment  by  type  of
establishment and by broad categories of employees from 2018 to 2020.
"The total number of establishments covered in the 2020 survey was 4,815. The total"
"number of employees in these establishments amounted to 175,990 as compared to"
"173,592 in 2019. This was an increase of 2,398 (1.4%)."
"Of the total tourism-based direct employment in 2020, 80% were employed in Hotels"
"and  Restaurants.  Travel  Agents  &  Tour  Operators  accounted  for  6.8%  of  the  total,"
"Airlines  5%,  Guides  3.4%,  State  Sector  1.9%,  Tourist  Shops  1.3%,  the  Agencies"
providing Recreational Facilities 0.7% and the National Tourist Organization 0.5%.
A classification of the total number in employment by broad occupational  categories
"shows that 14.7% belonged to managerial, scientific and professional grades, 51.6%"
"to technical, clerical, allied and supervisory grades and 33.6% to manual and operative"
grades (Table 27).
Table 27 in the Statistical Appendix shows only the volume of direct employment in the
tourism sector of the economy. In order to access the total employment in the tourism
"industry,  both  direct  and  indirect,  it  is  necessary  to  estimate  the  volume  of  indirect"
employment  that  tourist  spending  can  generate  in  ancillary  industries  such  as  the
"handicraft trade, gems and jewellery shops, liquor shops laundries, etc. In 2020, the"
"estimated total number for indirect employment was 171,764(Table 29). Therefore, the"
"total number in employment, both direct and indirect, in the tourism sector in 2020 can"
"be estimated as 347,751."
