Districts
ables 22 & 23 in the Statistical Appendix show monthly and annual occupancy rates
by District. The overall annual room occupancy rate recorded for all accommodation in
2020 was 14.9%. The occupancy rate recorded for 2019 was 57.1%.
The highest occupancy rate was recorded in the month of January (55.9%) and the
"lowest in the month of April (2.1%). Thus, the variation in occupancy rates between the"
busiest and the least busy months was 53.8% points. The closure of borders resulting
in  no  international  tourist  arrivals  and  fewer  domestic  tourists  due  to  the  pandemic
"situation, could be the likely reasons for the low occupancy rates."
"District wise, Galle recorded the highest occupancy rate of 23.2%. Kandy recorded an"
"occupancy rate of 22%, followed by Batticaloa (18.1%) Badulla (17.2%) Hambantota"
