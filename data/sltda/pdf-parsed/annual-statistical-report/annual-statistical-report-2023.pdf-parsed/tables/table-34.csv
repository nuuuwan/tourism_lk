"This pattern suggests that India is a key source market across all age groups, reflecting strong"
travel ties between India and Sri Lanka. The consistent presence of the United Kingdom and
Germany  among  the  older  age  groups  may  indicate  that  these  countries  have  an  older
"demographic  interested  in  Sri  Lanka,  possibly  due  to  historical  or  cultural  connections."
"Meanwhile, Russia's prominence in the younger age brackets could point to a growing interest"
"in Sri Lanka among younger Russian travelers, potentially driven by newer marketing efforts"
or emerging travel trends.
The gender distribution of tourists visiting Sri Lanka during the year reveals that 57.8% were
"female,  while  14.48%  were  male.  The  highest  number  of  female  tourists  came  from  the"
"Russian Federation, India, and the United Kingdom. In contrast, the largest number of male"
"tourists also originated from India, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom."
This distribution suggests that Sri Lanka's appeal as a travel destination is strong among both
"women  and  men  from  these  countries,  with  the  Russian  Federation,  India,  and  the  United"
"Kingdom being key source markets for both genders. The higher proportion of female tourists,"
"especially  from  Russia,  might  reflect  the  attractiveness  of  Sri  Lanka's  offerings,  such  as"
"wellness,  cultural  experiences,  or  perceived  safety,  which  resonate  particularly  well  with"
female travelers. The significant representation of male tourists from these countries indicates
"that  the  destination  also  holds  broad  appeal  across  different  demographics,  although  the"
reasons behind the gender disparity might warrant further investigation to understand specific
preferences  or  trends.  This  notable  difference  suggests  that  Sri  Lanka  may  be  particularly
"appealing to female travelers, possibly due to the types of experiences and attractions offered,"
or the perception of the country as a safe and desirable destination for women. The lower
"percentage of male visitors might point to different travel preferences or priorities among men,"
or it could indicate an opportunity for targeted marketing to increase male tourism.
