"An analysis of visitor statistics for Sri Lanka's wildlife parks indicates that Yala, Horton Plains, Udawalawa, Eth Athuru Sewana, and"
"Minneriya are the most frequented destinations. In terms of revenue, Yala, Udawalawa, Horton Plains, Wilpattu, and Minneriya lead"
"the rankings. Domestic visitors constitute approximately 57.9% of the total park attendance, while foreign tourists make up 42.07%."
"Notably,  foreign  ticket  sales  are  the  primary  revenue  source,  accounting  for  94.7%  of  total  earnings,  whereas  domestic  sales"
contribute only 2.6%. This underscores the critical importance of maintaining high park standards to continue attracting international
visitors.
"For domestic tourists, the top attractions are Horton Plains, Yala, Udawalawa, Eth Athuru Sewana, and Minneriya. In contrast, foreign"
"visitors  show  a  preference  for  Yala,  Udawalawa,  Eth  Athuru  Sewana,  Mirissa  (dolphin  and  whale  watching),  and  Minneriya.  The"
"significant overlap in popular sites among both local and international tourists, particularly Yala, Eth Athuru Sewana, and Udawalawa,"
"has  led  to  concerns  about  overcrowding.  To  mitigate  this,  it  is  advisable  to  promote  lesser-known  parks  such  as  Kaudulla  and"
Wasgamuwa.  Introducing  innovative  activities  in  these  underutilized  areas  can  effectively  redistribute  tourist  traffic  and  alleviate
pressure on the more popular parks.
"In 2024, Sri Lanka's wildlife parks attracted 44% of the total tourist arrivals."
