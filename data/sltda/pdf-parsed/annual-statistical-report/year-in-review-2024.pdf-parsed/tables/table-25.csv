Year in Review -2024
The  distribution  of  accommodation  facilities  across  Sri  Lanka's  districts  reflects  the  varying
"degrees of tourism development and visitor interest in each region. Districts such as Colombo,"
"Galle,  Gampaha,  Kalutara,  and  Kandy  have  a  high  concentration  of  rooms,  driven  by  their"
"prominence as tourist destinations and commercial centers. In contrast, districts like Mullaitivu"
"and Mannar have fewer accommodations, highlighting the potential for tourism development in"
these  underutilized  areas.  Strategic  efforts  to  enhance  tourism  in  underrepresented  districts
can lead to a more balanced and inclusive tourism industry nationwide.
