Distribution of rooms by provinces
The distribution of tourist accommodations in Sri Lanka is notably uneven across its provinces.
"The Western, Southern, and Central Provinces collectively account for a significant portion of"
"the country's total room capacity, with the Western Province alone comprising 36.0% of all"
"rooms, followed by the Southern Province at 25.5%, and the Central Province at 16.2%. In"
"stark  contrast,  the  Northern  Province  holds  a  mere  2.0%  of  the  total  accommodations,"
"underscoring  a  pronounced  regional  disparity.  Additionally,  the  Uva  Province  contributes"
5.1% to the overall room inventory.
This  concentration  of  accommodations  in  specific  provinces  can  be  attributed  to  several
"factors. The Western Province, encompassing Colombo, serves as the nation's commercial"
"and administrative hub, naturally attracting a higher influx of business and leisure travelers."
"The  Southern  Province  boasts  renowned  coastal  destinations  like  Galle  and  Hikkaduwa,"
which are popular among tourists for their pristine beaches and cultural heritage. The Central
"Province,  home  to  Kandy  and  the  scenic  hill  country,  offers  rich  cultural  experiences  and"
"natural beauty, making it a favoured destination for visitors."
"Conversely,  the  Northern  Province's limited share  of  accommodations  reflects  its  historical"
"context.  The  region  was  significantly  affected  by  prolonged  civil  conflict,  which  impeded"
"tourism development and infrastructure expansion. Although the conflict has ended, the area"
is still in the process of rebuilding and developing its tourism sector to attract more visitors.
