Figure 03: Distribution of rooms by province,
,"In terms of provincial distribution, the"
,majority of accommodations are
,"concentrated in the Western,"
,"Southern, and  Central  Provinces,"
,collectively representing a  significant
,share of the country's room
,"inventory.  Specifically, the  Western"
,Province stands out with the  highest
,"allocation of rooms, comprising 34%"
,"of the total, followed by the Southern"
,and Central Provinces at 26.6% and
,"16.6%, respectively.  Conversely,  the"
,Northern  Province has  a notably
,"lower proportion of rooms,"
,"accounting for only 1.8% of the total,"
,indicating a disparity in
,accommodation  distribution  across
,"regions. Additionally, the Uva"
,Province  contributes  5.2%  of the
,total rooms available.
,This distribution underscores a
,concentration of the accommodation
,"sector in specific regions, potentially"
,limiting the equitable development of
,tourism across the country. To foster
,more balanced growth and capitalize
,on the tourism potential of all
,"provinces,  there  is  a  pressing  need"
,to diversify tourism development
,"initiatives beyond the Western,"
,"Southern, and  Central  Provinces,"
