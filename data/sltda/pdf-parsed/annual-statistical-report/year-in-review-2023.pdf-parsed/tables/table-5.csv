"Throughout the year, there was a significant increase in tourist arrivals by 106.6% compared to the"
"corresponding months of the previous year, indicating a positive trajectory for Sri Lanka's  tourism"
industry.  This surge reflects a heightened interest in Sri Lanka as a preferred tourist destination.
"Of particular note, September witnessed the most substantial growth rate, soaring by 275.6% from"
"the  previous  year.  This  surge  could  be  attributed  to  various  factors,  including  favorable  weather"
conditions and holiday seasons in key source markets.
"December  marked  the  peak  tourist  season  with  the  highest  number  of  arrivals,  totaling  210,352"
"visitors.  This  underscores  December's  popularity,  likely  influenced  by  winter  vacations  and  other"
advantageous  conditions.
"Conversely, May recorded the lowest tourist arrivals, with 83,309 visitors. This decline may be due"
to less favorable weather conditions or fewer incentives  for travel  during this period.
